# The "lock" app is used to lock the threads of a closed issues or prs after (x) number of days of inactivity.
# This is to help prevent long-lived issues and prs after being resolved. If users still have issues after
# a closed PR or issue thread is locked, they should create a new issue. The locking of the thread does not
# occur immedatly after an issue or PR is closed. Users will still have an opportunity to re-open the issue.
# They can always back-link to an old locked issue in a new issue if they believe it is the one and the same.

daysUntilLock: 14
