__@brando2147__ says 
> Awesome! because I am having a very strange issue trying to get the tab bar / notification icons to correctly show when I build. Currently, it is showing a white circle instead of my app icon. I tried to add the following to my config.xml and doesn’t appear to use the icons. Does anybody know how to update these icons in android? Is there anything else that needs to be updated?
