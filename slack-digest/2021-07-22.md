> In my experience, Debugger issues are related to the iphone safari version being ahead of the macOS safari version, and usually using the safari tech preview fixes that.

__@dkirschner43__ says 
> Hello all i am also deploying a ios app from cordova.  I am using Playcanvas as my web framework.  I think i have everything working except there is no audio.  I have seen people talk about adding cordova-plugin-media.  If i did this i will have to refactor how my sound is played in the app.  Do i need to go through all of this or is there an easier way?

__@norman137__ says 
> This should be confirmed but i think the ios webview only allows audio playback from a user generated event, such as a trusted click event. Quickest way to test this is to add a regular dom node like a button or something and use `.addEventListener('click', function() { myAudio.play(); });` and see if your audio works that way. If so, that may explain why your audio isn't working. Events should have a `trusted` attribute which will be true if it came from an user (e.g wasn't programmatically created).

> cordova-plugin-media would be a solution to that since it just uses the native APIs to play audio, thus doesn't have such limitations.
> 
> To your refactoring problem, I would probably suggest implementing your own interface that hopefully can conform to your existing API usage to minimize refactoring and your own audio implementation can just use the cordova apis behind the scenes. This also has an added benefit of decoupling a particular implementation to your app which makes it easy to reuse your code / change audio implementation easily.

__@norman137__ says 
> The only other way is to google to see if you can find any other library that is maintained 🤷‍♂️ but I assumed you specifically wanted `phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner` -- and looking at it's network chart is the best way to discover forks that has had commits passed phonegap's version.
