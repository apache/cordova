__@slack.cordova.io-acco__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> it's not the iframe page that needs to send that header, it's the "webserver" that serves the page with the iframe that needs to. The problem is there is no webserver in the cordova context, so afaik that CSP policy header cannot be done. That issue is documented at <https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/issues/560>
> 
> For security reasons if you're loading an external website, it should be done in an inappbrowser, but that's not something I have ever used in my apps so I don't really know too much on the plugin. But i do believe there is a way for the main webview and the inappbrowser webview to communicate via `webkit.messageHandlers.cordova_iab.postMessage`? Pretty sure that can be used to signal the main webview by listening to the `message`event when to close the inappbrowser

__@slack.cordova.io-acco__ says 
> yep, tried the webkit.messageHandlers, which seems to be available when the execute script method is run on the inappbrowser...
> the main issue i had with that was with the timing of it, e.g. to know when to execute the script since none of the inappbrowser event listeners triggered any of the advertised events

__@slack.cordova.io-acco__ says 
> i'll try that again though, and keep polling with the executescript to see if i can at least send a message
