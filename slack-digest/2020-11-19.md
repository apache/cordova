__@joel__ says 
> Hi all.  I'm investigating some build errors for iOS related to a Cocoapod dependency we are adding.  The SDK is built with Swift.  Here's an exert of the errors:
> ```unknown&gt;:0: error: module map file 'xxx' not found
> &lt;unknown&gt;:0: error: module map file 'xxx' not found
> &lt;unknown&gt;:0: error: underlying Objective-C module 'xxx' not found
> error: cannot load underlying module for 'xxx'```
> We're only getting these errors on our build server, so it's a bit hard to diagnose.  Everything works fine locally.  There are not many differences between the environments though.
> 
> Cordova ClI: 9.0.0
> Cordova iOS: 6.1.1
> 
> I'm just wondering if anyone recognizes this problem and can potentially point in the right direction.

__@dpogue__ says 
> I recall running into this sort of error when I was missing `use-frameworks="true"` and hitting weird CocoaPods path issues (which turn out to be due to <https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/pull/671>)

Thu, 19 Nov 2020 03:09:12 GMT

__@joel__ says 
> Hmmm, thanks.  I've tried unsuccessfully with and without `use-frameworks` because that's one of the only levers I have ðŸ™‚.  But the SDK in question instructs to specify it.
