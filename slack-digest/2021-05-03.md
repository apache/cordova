> Hi all, I'm trying to upgrade cordova-media-plugin a bit for my app, and would like it to use the default music player controls instead of the ones that look kinda ancient. I'm having a hard time seeing what it is that triggers one or the other when looking in different repos. Anyone have any experience with media playback on Android that can point me in the right direction?

> If we're creating a PWA can we still use the Cordova plugins?  We're not adding the iOS or Android platforms for a PWA based on the tutorials I've seen, so can we still use the Cordova plugins like, Google + authentication, In App browser, push notifications etc?
