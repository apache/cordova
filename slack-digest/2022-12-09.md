__@norman137__ says 
> I'm still going to be around for the foreesable future in Slack especially since I use Slack for work, but there are 2 main problems with slack:
> 
> 1) It's tailored around private communities, such as workplace organizations. It doesn't inheritly support public communites. It requires workarounds to make that work for public communities.
> 2) Free tier of Slack limits search, so discussions tends to get lost, even if it could be helpful for other people.
> 
> Recently we got Apache to enable GitHub discussions for Cordova, we think it will be a better place for support/discussions as the threads will be permanently available and searchable, and all you need is a github account to participate, which most people using Cordova will likely already have.

__@dpogue__ says 
> GitHub Discussions currently aren't highlighted anywhere (except here) as a place for questions, so I expect it might take a bit before they catch on. For now, maybe post your question there and then send a message here with the link so that they get a bit more traffic ðŸ˜…

__@erisu__ says 
> Wonder if the search is based off titles and not as much from the thread content.
> 
> I see scope creep within the threads as well, not just GH issues ðŸ˜„
> 
> Title says one thing, discussions started out as such, and then split into multiple issues thats not related to original discussion.
> 
> If the search results were mostly based from the titles, it will then make finding information hard as pertinent Information is buried in wrong discussions thread.
