> Hello devs!  We have a brand new shiny site for code talk.  Apache has enabled github discussions.
> This new site, _*<https://github.com/apache/cordova/discussions|cordova/discussions>*_ is probably better for more async / long-form conversations, and can also be used as a resource to search if someone has already asked the same question.  Our free-tier use of #slack only lets us see the last 10k messages.
