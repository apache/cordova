__@mathewp.94__ says

__@mathewp.94__ says

__@mathewp.94__ says 
> I need to update my `AndroidManifest.xml` but the section I need to update is overwritten by an `after-prepare` hook that a plugin is running, so I figure the only ways to get around this are:
> 1. Create a plugin so I can run an `after-prepare` hook after the other plugin runs it's hook
> 2. Just write a script that I manually run after I run `cordova prepare android`
> 3. I guess I could also write a script that runs `cordova prepare android` and then modifies the XML if I feel especially lazy

> I'm not really familiar with that part of the codebase yet, but it looks like it always runs application hooks first, then plugin hooks.

> Out of those methods, the order appears to come in the order they are defined in the `config.xml` or `plugin.xml` file, but I don't think there is any defined order on which plugin has their hooks ran before another plugin.

__@norman137__ says

__@norman137__ says

__@dpogue__ says

Thu, 26 Nov 2020 22:13:18 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> My guess is either the order they're listed in package.json's `cordova` section, or alphabetically

__@mathewp.94__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> I don't think that's 100% correct... or maybe it's no longer the case because when searching for plugins it does this...
> 
> ```// Match normal and scoped plugins
>     const pluginXmlPaths = glob.sync('{,@*/}*/plugin.xml', {
>         cwd: absPath,
>         nodir: true,
>         absolute: true
>     }).map(path.normalize);```
> So whatever order this glob gives is when scanning the file system directory is whatever order the plugin xml paths will be loaded in to look for hooks. The order of `glob.sync` will probably end up being whatever order the OS gives you when listing directory contents, which I think is generally alphabetical.

> 
> We run some functions on the `hook` and `opts` args before we do the args check, seems dangerous?
> Unless we are assuming that hook will always be defined, in whichcase the `if (!hook)`  statement isn't necessary
