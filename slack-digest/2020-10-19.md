> @slack.cordova.io-acco @norman137 I'm having some issues with rendering a google reCAPTCHA from an external site using inappbrowser plugin for iOS, and I was thinking you guys might know the answer. The In App Browser will render some of the content on the page, but not the captcha itself. I was thinking it could be related to the Content Security Policy preventing some js from running. The page will load fine on android app, so I'm thinking it might be some internal issue with the plugin or ios preventing it from loading. When I open the external site by itself in chrome, the captcha loads fine but I'm wondering if this error in the console could be related to the problem of it not rendering in the inappbrowser plugin.
