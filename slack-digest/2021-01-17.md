__@gh__ says 
> The only thing I'm aware of being discontinued in the Cordova ecosystem is PhoneGap. Long ignored by Adobe, they pulled the plug a few months ago. Other products, such as <https://volt.build/|VoltBuilder>, Monaca and Ionic Capacitor have taken its place (and probably all do a better job than PhoneGap did). (Disclosure: I'm on the VoltBuilder dev team, and we're very much alive.)
