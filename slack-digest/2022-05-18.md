__@michael.a.oshea__ says 
> Hi all,
> 
> it's me again with the usual "why doesn't my app appear in Play Store for [the latest version of Android] devices?".
> 
> In this case: Android 12.
> 
> As far as I can tell, my app complies with <https://developer.android.com/google/play/requirements/target-sdk> and <https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12>
> 
> Last time, the problem was with Android 11 and was caused by the AndroidManifest.xml *not* containing
> 
> &lt;uses-sdk android:maxSdkVersion="29" android:minSdkVersion="22" android:targetSdkVersion="29" /&gt;
> 
> This time, with Android 12, I changed that to
> 
> &lt;uses-sdk android:maxSdkVersion="31" android:minSdkVersion="22" android:targetSdkVersion="31" /&gt;
> 
> ... and when that app didn't appear in the Play Store listing, I changed to ...
> 
> &lt;uses-sdk android:maxSdkVersion="30" android:minSdkVersion="22" android:targetSdkVersion="30" /&gt;
> 
> That also does not appear for Android 12 devices.
> 
> In order to be able to isolate the problem, I decided to build the basic "hello world" and make it pass as my full app and then publish it to Internal Test.
> 
> The build works fine and generates an aab file, the signing works fine, publishing it to Internal Test works fine.
> 
> Older devices (Android 11, older) signed onto an account that is listed as a tester *do*  see this new version of the app.
> 
> Devices running Android 12 (also signed in as an account that is listed as a tester) don't see it.
> 
> Here's the technical description of my work environment:

__@norman137__ says 
> When you specify a max SDK version, you're saying that your app is not supported on any newer device, and they won't appear in the play store.

> **Most** of the time, Google will only introduce behaviour differences when you upgrade your target SDK, so even if you haven't build or tested your app against hte latest SDK, it should still work. Google however does reserve the right to force changes regardless of the target sdk, but in the interest of having older apps just work on new devices, they try to avoid doing that.
