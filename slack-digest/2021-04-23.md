> &gt; Dear Developer,
> &gt; We identified one or more issues with a recent delivery for your app, "RollCall - &gt;LMS Attendance" 19.0.0 (22). Your delivery was successful, but you may wish to correct the following issues in your next delivery:
> &gt; ITMS-90725: SDK Version Issue - This app was built with the iOS 13.2 SDK. All iOS apps submitted to the App Store must be built with the iOS 13 SDK or later, included in Xcode 11 or later. Further, starting April 26, 2021 iOS apps submitted to the App Store must be built with the iOS 14 SDK or later, included in Xcode 12 or later.
> &gt; After youâ€™ve corrected the issues, you can upload a new binary to App Store Connect.
> &gt; Best regards,
> &gt; The App Store Team
> I'm really surprised Apple has not given us more of a heads up about this! Unless another Cordova iOS release is imminent, this means the Cordova community won't be able to submit app updates for a while, right?

__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hi folks, Android recently introduced the `loadThumbnail`<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentResolver#loadThumbnail(android.net.Uri,%2520android.util.Size,%2520android.os.CancellationSignal)| method on >`ContentResolver`, as part of a deprecation of `MediaStore.Video.Thumbnails`. I am looking for a way to get the file path of the bitmap that's produced by `loadThumbnail`. Yes, this is very similar to all the many StackOverflow questions about getting the file path from a bitmap, but all the answers I've seen indicate that the bitmap has to be saved to a file, then the path of that file is used. But `loadThumbnail` has already created the image, so I don't want to duplicate it on the device's file system. So my question is this:
