> In my Chrome Remote Debug I see this error
> `DevTools failed to load SourceMap: Could not load content for file:///android_asset/www/dist/bundle.js.map:`

> However I can clearly see the actual file in question in my folder in the right place, If the app recognizes my bundle.js shouldn't it recognize the map also since there in same directory? Source maps is enabled in Chrome preferences

__@osaintilien55__ says 
> Hmm and you use webpack? I'm seeing there is a plugin called SourceMapDevToolPlugin for webpack, hoping this will  help.

__@norman137__ says 
> `SourceMapDevToolPlugin` is used by webpack behind the scenes when you use the `devtool` configuration. Using the plugin directly will expose more advanced options though.

> I use `devtool: 'inline-source-map',` for my debug builds for source maps.

__@osaintilien55__ says 
> Wow such a simple fix! I had it set to just source-map, but inline-source-map made the difference

> If you have secrets that you want to keep safe, don't put them in the app. Instead put the software on a server with an API that your app can call. That's why cloud-based Software as a Service is so popular these days.

__@norman137__ says 
> Btw this isn't a problem exclusive to Cordova apps either. Native iOS apps written in both objective-c or swift can also be reversed engineered, as with Android apps written in Java.

Wed, 17 Mar 2021 22:31:18 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Lots of minification libraries out there -- they'll strip out comments, replace variable names with single letter names. Usually they make aliases so that they can replace `document.getElementByID` with something shorter for example... In general strings are left untouched however. Most bundles like webpack has some libraries built in out there.
> 
> There are probably obfuscation libraries out there as well, that would replace strings with some executable code that would produce an equivalent string output when ran, just won't be obvious unless you actually copy/execute the code in a JS environment.
