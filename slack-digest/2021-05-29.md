__@admin105__ says 
> Hello. We have just gotten our app running in Cordova, and we are finding that while our pages are rendering as expected, when we navigate to a URL such as YouTube, we are seeing multiple issues: it's rendering up into the status bar/ignoring the iPhone notch, not giving a back button or swipe-to-go-back. What is the "cordova" way of doing / strategy to debug this?
