__@marcin.zielezny__ says 
> In  Cordova Electron 3.0 new plugin system has been introduced - have it also dropped "old" plugins implementation with "nodeIntegration" set? Is now nodeIntegration prohibited, and cannot be enabled ? After update I get only error "Electron Node.js integration is disabled, you can not use cordova-file-plugin without it
> Check docs how to enable Node.js integration:"

__@erisu__ says 
> Docs were not updated and it will be removed from the docs.

> You might be able to still use it but was not tested.

> The nodeIntegration is a bad idea since it creates a major security risks to the end user. Even Electron docs says not to use it.. It can expose the entire frontend application to node_modules where then any third-party plugin could start accessing and manipulating the users file system or even launch processes.

> I am not sure what is cordova-file-plugin, unless you mean the Apache plugin cordova-plugin-file which never supported Electron natively.

__@marcin.zielezny__ says 
> That was plugin created by me, so ok I will digg what happens with nodeIntegration parameter. For now risks is OK for me ( I have to handle few cases as TCP communication, file access) - are you planning update docs for plugins creation ?

__@erisu__ says 
> I can't give you an exact date on when there will be documentation on Cordova docs for Electron plugin creation, but I had been trying to write up a detailed blog post on my site to explain from start to end. It will cover one type of use case.

__@erisu__ says 
> I have already also merged in Electron native support for the device plugin so you could kinda glance at its implementation pattern to see how I did it.
