__@lukas__ says 
> Hi everyone,
> I am trying to upgrade Cordova Android from 8.0.0 to 9.1.0. When trying to create the build with Cordova it fails most of the time (but not always). However creating the build with Android Studio works fine. I suspected that it might be related to different Gradle versions but both use 6.5. Do you have any pointers of what could be wrong here?

__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hi folks, can I use the `file-transfer` plugin to upload files that are in the app itself, rather than on the device? I want to upload some of the app's image assets, but I'm not able to get them at the correct path. The images are located in the `www/img` folder. In the upload function, I tried using `/img/asset.jpg`, `file:///img/asset.jpg`, but I still get errors. Any ideas for how to do this?
