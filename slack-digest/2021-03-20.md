> Hi all. Has anyone managed to release an update to an app to the Google Play Store and install it on their Android 11 device?
> 
> The new update for my App appears OK in the store to devices &lt; Android 11 but the app does not show up in the store for Android 11 apps.
> 
> I can't see any error messages anywhere that explain why Android 11 phones don't see the app. I have tried to target API lvl 30 (that works) but the update still doesn't appear for devices running with Android 11.

> Has this happened to anyone here?
