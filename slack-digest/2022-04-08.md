__@norman137__ says 
> No, that's coming in the next major release.
> 
> We are planning on doing one last patch release for v10, then we will start merging in v11 PRs in, including <https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/pull/1410> which sets up the core to the point where it can at least run the Hello Cordova app.
> 
> If you like, you can test the PR against your own app, to determine what changes are needed in plugins to support API 31. There will be changes required in your environment including:
> 
> - Java 11 JDK is now required. Java 8 is no longer supported by the android tooling for API 31 tooling.
> - `cmdline-tools` needs to be installed from Android SDK tools, and your `PATH` variable updated accordingly. I tested using the current latest version, which is `6.0`. I'd advise against using the `latest` version, which always points to the latest version, which I assume may include breaking changes in the future.
> - Build tools 31.0.0 needs to be installed and your `PATH` variable updated accordingly.
