__@brettr91__ says 
> Having issues with cordova-file-transfer after updating to SDK30, and android 10.1.1 returning code 1 (file or directory not found) on a pdf download. I have also added cordova-plugin-android-permissions to request permission before the download and added Read, Write and Manage permissions to our android manifest via config xml. I was wondering if anyone can see if I am missing something?
