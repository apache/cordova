__@norman137__ says 
> If you're trying to audit the javascript side, you can use ctrl/cmd+r while the inspector is focused to reload the webview. Also using chrome audit tools which also reloads the webview can help performance audit app loading. But none of these will include the splashscreen, as that occurs in the native side before the webview is even created. This would basically only include the time it takes to load the webview html and initialize plugins (e.g. the time between document load and `deviceready` event), etc.
> 
> If you wanted to include splashscreen, you'd need to use the Android Studio native tools, abeit I'm not that familiar with the tooling available, I do know it has some performance audit tools. I'm also making an assumption that you can launch the app with profiling attached so that you can audit from native app launch to whenever. This would be required so that you can audit before the webview is created. Cordova has an existing android project located at `&lt;cordova-project&gt;/platforms/android` that can be opened with Android Studio.

__@erikyuzwa__ says 
> a weird issue - running `ios@5.1.2.x`  and am unable to see my webview without the use of the `cordova-plugin-ionic-webview` plugin. Not using ionic at all in my codebase. I've tried removing the plugin, removing / readding the ios platform but the cordova startup routine just hangs. The startup makes it past the *`Apache Cordova native platform version 5.1.1 is starting.`* but then hangs soon after `handleopenurl`any ideas / things to look at? 🙇‍♂️🏼

__@norman137__ says 
> Not sure what you mean by running `ios@5.1.2.x`... `cordova-ios@5.1.1` is the most recent version of the 5.x major. Is there any reason why you're not running 6.x? `cordova-ios@5.1.1` has some nasty hacks to get around the `UIWebView` deprecation stuff. If possible I'd at least attempt to run 6.x. FWIW, I use the ionic webview as well, just the webview, not their entire framework with cordova-ios@6 with no issues. (But I was running that setup with cordova-ios@5.1.1 as well)

__@erikyuzwa__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> Yah I'm not sure, iOS isn't really in my field of expertise. I'd recommend creating a sample project and slowly start adding plugins and see if you can get a simple reproduction app going... and if you can, then that would be helpful to share.
