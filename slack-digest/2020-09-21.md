> Hello everyone, what can be possible reason that `deviceready` event listener is not getting called ?
> `document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, true);`  I have this line and debugger is stopping here but after that I am expecting that `onDeviceReady` method should get called but it is not called. Not sure what is the reason behind this.
> Has anyone have idea about this ?
