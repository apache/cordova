__@norman137__ says 
> Crashing in what way? The entire app is closing down or you're just seeing a white screen or something? If the latter... best way to debug startup issues on safari is to launch the app, load the safari web inspector, then use cmd+r while the web inspector is focused to refresh the webview in the app. Safari doesn't report on log events that occurred before the inspector was attached, so this will get safari to report on any potential JS errors that is occurring on launch.

> If the former... you're gunna have to look at the xcode logs for the native output for hints.

__@iamfrankstallone__ says 
> What causes iOS’s native accessibility features from zooming text in Cordova apps? I first started with our `meta` viewport with `content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5"` which I believe should allow for user scaling of a website, but changing the mobile Safari settings for Page Zoom, nor Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text &gt; Large Text scaled up changes the text size on our app.

__@norman137__ says 
> `content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5` should allow your app to accept pinch to zoom gesture.

__@iamfrankstallone__ says 
> We would rather _not_ allow pinch to zoom, but we would want users to bump up the text

__@iamfrankstallone__ says

__@dpogue__ says

__@iamfrankstallone__ says

__@iamfrankstallone__ says 
> This feels like a great solution, for Apple devices, but we support Android, too. We’ll want font scaling available for them there as well.

__@dpogue__ says 
> I _think_ on Android, if you set all your font sizes as `em` then it will work

Tue, 24 Nov 2020 15:39:07 GMT

__@iamfrankstallone__ says

__@dpogue__ says

__@iamfrankstallone__ says

__@iamfrankstallone__ says 
> I realized that there is no set `px` font for _any_ of the items in the Chat bot window I spoke of above. That is probably why it scales so well.

__@iamfrankstallone__ says 
> Follow up: Moved our font variables to `rem`s and that seems to have done the trick in iOS to make all views update text size when going to Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text Size &gt; Display &amp; Text Size &gt; Large Text &gt; Bumping up the scale.

__@tomkinson__ says 
> Is anyone doing hot code pushes in development at the moment? Is there some best practices or a plugin you recommend? I see the hot-push plugin was depreciated in '18 so if anyone has an alternate recommendation we're all ears (and very interested how you do it). Thanks in advance! 👊

__@norman137__ says 
> hmm I dont think this does native or auto reloads... but cordova can serve the cordova web assets using the `cordova serve` command. It will run a webserver that you can point the `&lt;content src&gt;` to. Some more details at <https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-cli/#cordova-serve-command>

> Hot code pushes for development is not something I really do... though I acknowledge it could save a lot of time especially in active development.
