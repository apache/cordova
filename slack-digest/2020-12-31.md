> Sadly there is nothing you can do, I reported 3 separate related issues on WebKit issue tracker and none of them got any activity or attention, better use some plugin that uses native listeners

__@norman137__ says 
> For Generating PDFs... JavaScript solutions are poor or inaccurate in my experience. If you need to maintain offline capability, then you'll need to have a cordova plugin that communicates with generating the pdf natively. I'm not experienced on generating PDFs on Cordova so I'm not sure what kind of issues you'd run into.
> 
> If your clients are expected to have an internet connection, then backend solutions are also possible, like sending the HTML code to your backend for it to generate the PDF for your client to download. On the backend, You can use chrome headless to render and save to pdf via CLI: `chrome --headless --print-to-pdf="d:\\{{path and file name}}.pdf" <https://google.com>`

They can also add the platforms that they want build or test for by using the `cordova platform add` command. This works well, as for example my apps we support both android and iOS... but my primarily workstation is not a mac, so I primarily only develop and test against android. There's another team member with a mac who will test and release the ios versions.
