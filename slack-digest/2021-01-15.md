> hey all, I have problems after updating to 6.x and so from uiwebview to wkwebview. when i'm now launching the app, I see just a white screen. <https://cordova.apache.org/howto/2020/07/18/uiwebview-warning.html> Regarding this instruction, i think that the wkurlschemehandler is a problem, but I dont't understand how this:
> ```&lt;preference name="scheme" value="app" /&gt;
> &lt;preference name="hostname" value="localhost" /&gt;```

> White screens are usually caused by JS errors occurring on startup. To see them launch the safari web inspector then press cmd+r while the inspector is focused. The inspector only captures log events when it is opened and attached so it doesn't record startup errors. This will refresh the webview with the inspector still attached so you'll see those kind of errors. This may give you some better insights.
