__@norman137__ says 
> Those are CORS errors. CORS is intentionally very vague. If you're attempting to load an external resource, the server must implement the CORS protocol. If the resources are local, then you may need to use schemes, which is talked about in this blog post: <https://cordova.apache.org/howto/2020/07/18/uiwebview-warning.html>

__@erisu__ says

__@daviesd__ says

Thu, 20 Aug 2020 15:44:38 GMT
