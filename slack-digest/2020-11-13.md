__@osaintilien55__ says 
> Is it safe to continue working on the project from the www folder if the build android cmd is still running? I would think not, but just wanted to see if others do. I ask because build cmd takes some time.

__@norman137__ says 
> cordova build essentially just copes the www directory into the platform during its prepare step, it should be relatively safe. Obviously you risk building a broken build if you make changes to two different files where one file depends on the change of the second file... and the prepare step runs in between those changes. But if that happens you'd just have to run build again.

__@mathewp.94__ says 
> Hello there, I was wondering how I would go about contributing to cordova-ios?
> I have a feature request, and I'm happy to implement the code myself as it's a minor change.
> Should I just make a PR or should I discuss the changes here first?

__@mathewp.94__ says 
> The `Orientation` preference isn't quite as explicit as I would like, ideally I'd be able to select `portraitUpright` or something like that, which would translate to the app being locked to portrait orientation. At the moment if you use `portrait` as your setting, the app can orient itself as portrait or upside-down depending on the device's orientation.

__@mathewp.94__ says 
> Changing a preference like this probably requires a change to the android lib for Cordova as well (which I also don't mind doing)

__@osaintilien55__ says 
> So I had this error below pop up. I then ran "gradle --warning-mode=all", and then I reran build android, and this same error comes up telling me to use "--warning-mode all" to see the the warnings. How do I do this correctly?
> 
> Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 7.0.
> Use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings.

__@joshua__ says 
> What are the implications of the new “Apple silicon”  macs on Cordova development. Like tools and libraries (IDEs, NodeJS)?

Fri, 13 Nov 2020 07:23:28 GMT

__@purplecabbage__ says 
> There will definitely be issues.  Node project has their work cut out for them, and modules that compile on native will fail.  This will likely impact cordova tooling.

__@norman137__ says 
> We talked briefly about androidx in the past, which can be found in this <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarY6ZYj-CU|video> (one of the first topics that was talked about in the video)... but there are changes that are being done in API 30 that may force us to use androidx. I forget where to find that discussion... not sure if it was somewheres on slack or if it was on github... but I think it involved requiring the use of <https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/webkit/WebViewAssetLoader|WebViewAssetLoader> . @dpogue participated in that discussion, maybe he can find it.

__@niklasmerz__ says 
> Maybe we could talk about CI. Like how to move plugins to Github Actions. <http://travis-ci.org|travis-ci.org> is moving to <http://travis-ci.com|travis-ci.com> <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/migrate/open-source-repository-migration>

Thu, 12 Nov 2020 13:12:05 GMT

__@niklasmerz__ says 
> Yeah that is bad. All builds are red for some time. Maybe it works with .com 😄

Thu, 12 Nov 2020 13:34:48 GMT

__@timbru__ says 
> Doubt it, but we should be able to move away from Travis and just use SauceLabs and/or BrowserStack for manual testing. But seems this is a topic up for discussion, especially because paramedic has lots of SauceLabs specific code. (that could be removed, too?)
> 

Thu, 12 Nov 2020 13:37:34 GMT

__@niklasmerz__ says 
> Yeah paramedic could need some improvements. We could discuss what to do in the future. Builds were really slow in the past too
