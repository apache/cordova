__@marek.kozela__ says 
> Hi everyone, we want to use realm mobile database for Cordova project. I am a beginner in this field so my question is if we can use this approach. I already read some docs and found out that it is ready for React Native but what about the combination of React and Cordova? Is it suitable or what type of database should we use for project? Currently we are using SqlCipher and we want to replace that with something better. Thanks a lot for some guidance.
