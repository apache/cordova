__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hi folks, is there a way to delay loading plugins that you know you won't need until a very specific scenario in the app? For instance I want to have a sharesheet but it's in a part of the app that won't be used often. Right now I have to install the sharesheet plugin and the script is injected as part of the initial app load so it has to be parsed and executed, but I would like to avoid that until I absolutely need the plugin. Is this possible? Thanks.

__@jacob.wallace__ says 
> Hi all, I'm currently building an iOS app using Cordova. I haven't been able to find any information on how to disable the "haptic feedback" or small vibration that occurs when you tap and hold (long press) for a few milliseconds within the app. I have places where users will need to press and hold various UI buttons, and the vibration is pretty jarring since it's not providing useful feedback to the user. Is there a way to disable this vibration with a Cordova API for iOS?

__@erisu__ says 
> Actually that might be old settings. I was reading up on others who seen this type of issue in general.. The setting seems to be now a dropdown and mine is set to automatic and I didn’t have this type of issue. But I also have not run the system update yet which I will do later.
