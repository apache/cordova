__@marshall__ says 
> Hey everyone. I'm not exactly sure how to describe the issue I'm having. We're using a React/Cordova hybrid for our app. Recently, and I haven't been able pinpoint when yet, we started having an issue where tapping back to go to a previous view would take you to the appropriate route, but entire sections of the app would be cut off. I've attached a screenshot for reference.
> 
> Immediately upon scrolling, even 1px, the rest of the screen appears and operates normally. This issue does not occur in development in the browser, so it has something to do with when it's rendered on the device. I'm wondering if it's related to the new cordova-ios package or maybe WKWebView? I've googled this exhaustively and can't find anything. Anyone have any ideas?

__@dpogue__ says 
> oh! That is a WKWebView bug, it happens in my app as well, but I've never had time to try to put together a reproducible test case

__@dpogue__ says 
> My first suggestion is to turn off any `filter`/`webkit-filter` in CSS and maybe also turn off `box-shadow`

__@marshall__ says 
> We don't have a `filter` applied, but obviously those cards have a shadow

__@marshall__ says

Thu, 15 Oct 2020 19:15:55 GMT

__@marshall__ says 
> Got it. Not sure if it helps with that or not, but we've noticed that preventing `scrollTop = 0` works on SOME views. In our case, if a user goes to a view, scrolls, and then goes back to the previous view, there's no issue. But if you go to a view, and then go back in history without scrolling we can reproduce it almost every time.

__@dpogue__ says 
> oh, our fix was terrible... we basically did `setTimeout(() =&gt; window.scrollTo(0, 1), 100)`

__@marshall__ says

__@marshall__ says

Thu, 15 Oct 2020 19:29:41 GMT

__@marshall__ says

Thu, 15 Oct 2020 19:29:55 GMT

__@marshall__ says 
> We'll give it a shot, but I'd rather not pull them all out if it doesn't really help

Thu, 15 Oct 2020 19:29:57 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> I don't think `box-shadow` ended up making a difference, we'd been using `filter: drop-shadow` and that was definitely causing lots of weird rendering glitches
> 

Thu, 15 Oct 2020 19:31:17 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> It's just so hard because it's not 100% reliably reproducible even in the app, and then you need to try to build a reduced test case without all the rest of your app logic, but including all of your app styles, and any change to anything might end up being the culprit

Thu, 15 Oct 2020 19:31:33 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> But WebKit basically won't even look at it without some sort of test case that reliably reproduces it 😞

__@marshall__ says 
> @dpogue Do you guys use -`webkit-transform: translateZ(0)` anywhere

Thu, 15 Oct 2020 19:34:57 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> I don't think so

Thu, 15 Oct 2020 19:35:11 GMT

__@marshall__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> I've had my share of weird browser bugs but I don't think I've seen that one specifically. I also use react web in combination with corodva in my apps.
> 
> If using the web inspector and modifying any style (even like a background color) corrects the issue, then it kinda proves it's a browser bug, where the problem is correcting itself on another repaint (or relayout depending on what css value you changed). In my experience, it's always caused by some combination of CSS/html structure that is very obscure and hard to pinpoint.
> 
> My favourite one that occurred recently on my web portal is a problem where IE11 was painting the parent node on top of it's children when you  make heavy use of nested flex boxes... and you can correct the behaviour by attaching a `z-index: 0;` to the parent node. But you can't just select the parent node using any css-selector to add the z-index... the `z-index: 0;` property must be within the same CSS block as where you set `display: flex;`

Thu, 15 Oct 2020 22:00:58 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> Yeah, it's 100% a browser rendering bug. WebKit doesn't realize it has to repaint a tile, or thinks the tile is occluded, or something like that. Hence scrolling 1px fixes it

Thu, 15 Oct 2020 22:01:31 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> I meant to dig into it with a custom WebKit build where I can enable debugging output for rendering stuff, but it's not been high on the priority list and it's a bit daunting

__@norman137__ says 
> I read API 29 is a bit screwy because it was actually released early to add support for covid-related features. So there API behaviour changes but with flags to revert that behaviour back to API 28 behaviour, but still provides features for covid tracking apps. Those temporary flags like the `requestLegacyExternalStorage` is going away in API 30.
