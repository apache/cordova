__@flop__ says 
> Hi
> I used cordova-plugin-photo-library to show pictures located on the devices. Someone forked the plugin to make it compatible with cordova-ios but the method getLibrary is not really working.
> getLibrary gives you the pictures of your library with a url using the custom scheme "cdvphotolibrary". These urls gives you now a 404 message.
> I tried to fix it by myself by adding a urlSchemeHandler but it seems like adding an URLSchemeHandler is not worked because after adding the URLSchemeHandler for "cdvphotolibrary" I asked WKWebViewConfiguration about the scheme handlers for that url scheme and it tells me there is no scheme handler for that scheme. Meanwhile asking the WKWebViewConfiguration about the URLScheme of my app (app://) returns a valid URLSchemeHandler.
> I don't know how I can fix this issue. It would be great if someone could give me an advice what I could try.
> This is by the way the forked version of the plugin <https://github.com/tien271/cordova-plugin-photo-library-wkwebview>

__@norman137__ says 
> Never had a problem like that, but ndon't relaly owrk with audio/video stuff either. Maybe you need to explicitly set `android-webview-video-poster:` to the img-src directive?
