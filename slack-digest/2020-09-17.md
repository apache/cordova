__@norman137__ says 
> Cordova doesn't really dictate CSS or feature support in general. It's the underlying webview that does. On android this can range, but on modern devices the webview can be updated independently (so feature support should be good for most user devices). On iOS, webview is tied to iOS version. Best to refer to <https://caniuse.com/> for specifics, or refer to the MDN page for the particular CSS property to see browser compatibilty.

> *Most* of the time, WKWebView behaves the same as mobile safari on the same iOS version, when it comes to JS and CSS.

__@norman137__ says 
> Small correction to my statement, Cordova does fill in gaps where browser support is lacking or extremely inconsistent, by providing a native implementation in the forms of plugins, ie. the cordova-plugin-file for filesystem support. But this generally only applies to javascript features, not css features.

__@osaintilien55__ says 
> Okay so just to be sure I understand clearly. "Generally Speaking" The webview version of a device is tied to the version of the device's OS. And so with the caniuse website I can find out which version of any OS where a CSS property would not be supported.

> Is there a way I can find out which device's webview update independently?

__@norman137__ says 
> android allows the webview to be updated independent starting android 5.x. `cordova-android@9` min android support is 5.1, so if you're using the latest version of cordova-android@9 any user should be running on an android OS version that allows the webview to be updated independently from the OS.
> 
> Whether the user actually installs updates is another question however, so just because they are on an android device, doesn't mean they have access to the latest version of the chrome webview. Also... my android 5 device seems to stop receiving updates for the chrome webview, as it's on chrome 77 without any updates available, so for older devices updates may be cut off as well, but I'm not exactly sure on the policy.

__@norman137__ says 
> iOS devices don't have updatable webviews. They are baked into the OS, so the webview updates with the OS updates.

__@osaintilien55__ says 
> Hmm okay got it. In general are there certain CSS properties that you try to avoid using?

Wed, 16 Sep 2020 16:48:57 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> most of the time you only have to worry about CSS support if you're using bleeding edge css features or if you have to support IE.

__@jberman__ says 
> Hey guys, my Cordova app loads some initial content from the local device, but then also makes XHR requests to user-defined servers. I’m in the process now of moving to cordova-ios 6.1.0 and figuring out the CORS issues and what needs to change in our products to keep things working. I’ve read @norman137’s excellent blog post on CORS as well as every piece of documentation I could find. Is it fair to say that if you want to avoid any hacky solutions, the only way to proceed is to specify a custom scheme in the cordova app and then configure each server to allow that scheme?

Wed, 16 Sep 2020 17:21:04 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> using schemes will help relieve CORS-related issues on local resources, because while on the `file://` protocol, everything is considered a cross-origin request.
> 
> Then for external resources, the webserver must use the CORS headers to allow that scheme yes. If your server is used for multiple purposes (such as to power a website and your cordova app), then you may need business logic to hold a list of acceptable origin points and only return the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header if the request origin is acceptable.

__@jberman__ says 
> Right, you explained that very well in your blog post — thank you. I just wanted to make sure there was no legitimate client-side solution, and it sounds like there’s not. For the scheme, is that “app/localhost” just an example scheme name? Would it make sense to replace it with our app’s name, or just use “app” and “localhost”?

Wed, 16 Sep 2020 17:24:44 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> that's the default value if you have schemes enabled, but you can change it to whatever you desire, for as long as the scheme isn't conflicting with a "well-known scheme" such as http or https.

__@norman137__ says 
> Once you pick on, it's best to stick with it, because it changes the origin point, thus your web storage containers.

__@jcesarmobile__ says

Wed, 16 Sep 2020 17:33:28 GMT

__@jberman__ says 
> @jcesarmobile Is a native connection plugin a drop-in replacement, or does it come with its own set of issues and code changes?
