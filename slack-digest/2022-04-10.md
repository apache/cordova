> Looks like 15.5 has the potential to resolve some of the issues in my split view plugin.  But I'm always a bit sad to see workarounds that took a lot of effort rendered obsolete. Also I have to investigate a cosmetic issue that's emerged recently in a decade-old app. An image and text are colliding.  The HTML/javascript  hasn't changed since iOS 5 and this is the first time it has broken.  The app's native code however has needed constant revision, mostly to replace deprecated stuff.
