__@norman137__ says 
> `AndroidXEnabled` preference is essentially forcefully enabled in cordova-android@10.

> Not sure what `cordova-plugin-androidx` is suppose to do. Plugins that uses old/legacy support libraries (e.g. `android.support` packages) will not work as is. `cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter` is a common solution for plugin authors that doesn't have the capacity or refuses to to update their plugins to use the androidx libraries.

__@daviesd__ says 
> Sorry, I meant cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter (typo).  I removed both and things seem to be working.  My coworker is having trouble launching in the emulator (warning about android.useAndroidX).  It's running fine for me.  So I guess my plugins are androidx compliant?  I have a not so fuzzy warm feeling about that.  Wonder if I should throw it in for good measure

__@norman137__ says 
> legacy android support libraries and androidx will not compile together though so it should be pretty obvious if you have plugins using legacy support libraries

> I thought I needed it initially.  But I was discouraged because then Android started marking it as a bad app and asking to remove it.  Turns out I didn't need that flag (whew).  But I imagine this is gonna bite a few people

__@norman137__ says 
> Depends, it mostly bites people who used a lot of file system paths in their DOM, something I personally kinda consider bad practice... if you want to interact with the file system, use the appropriate FS APIs, but that's just my personal opinion ðŸ˜„

__@jcesarmobile__ says 
> The only problems with no using file are:
> 1. Data loss if you are updating an app. Browser storage (localStorage, websql) is tied to the url, so switching to http/https makes the app to lose the stored information. Is not really lost, just not reachable. There are plugins for moving the data.
> 2. CORS. When loading from file there are no CORS restrictions, but you are restricted if using http/https. But you are already restricted on iOS, so should be able to handle it too
> At least those are the two that I remember
