__@andrew867__ says

__@norman137__ says

Tue, 18 May 2021 15:22:08 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Tue, 18 May 2021 15:22:34 GMT

__@norman137__ says

__@andrew867__ says

Tue, 18 May 2021 15:32:31 GMT

__@andrew867__ says

__@andrew867__ says 
> What happens if you defer the execution of the `getFile` - in case it’s being caused by the `requestFileSystem` executing the success callback too soon, before the device has initialised the local storage?

Tue, 18 May 2021 15:56:07 GMT

__@andrew867__ says 
> Might be a bit like “teaching ma to suck eggs”, but you are waiting on the `deviceReady` state before attempting to access the File System

Tue, 18 May 2021 15:58:04 GMT

__@matt226__ says 
> Yes, and then some, it is a used based interaction that initiates the save, just putting a 5 second sleep before writing the file

Tue, 18 May 2021 16:00:50 GMT

__@matt226__ says 
> Well sleeping for 5 seconds seems promising, I wonder why the callback would fire before it is ready

__@andrew867__ says

Tue, 18 May 2021 16:08:03 GMT

__@andrew867__ says 
> So I’d execute the `requestFileSystem` early on, storing the reference to `root` off somewhere for use later.

Tue, 18 May 2021 16:08:43 GMT

__@andrew867__ says

Tue, 18 May 2021 22:06:23 GMT

__@jcesarmobile__ says 
> If you want to open a specific app, you need to know the package and use it to open. If you want to open the app using https url then they need to have the app links configured and should just work you shouldn’t need to do anything. If you already have the https url to google maps it shouldn’t prompt you to use a different app, unless they didn’t configure the app links properly

Tue, 18 May 2021 22:07:05 GMT

__@jcesarmobile__ says

> Hi, When we are trying to upload the .apk into google play store got the below three warning, can any one help us to fix this. 
>  Warning
> This APK results in unused code and resources being sent to users. Your app could be smaller if you used the Android App Bundle. By not optimizing your app for device configurations, your app is larger to download and install on users’ devices than it needs to be. Larger apps see lower install success rates and take up storage on users’ devices.
> Warning
> This APK contains Java/Kotlin code, which might be obfuscated. We recommend you upload a deobfuscation file to make your crashes and ANRs easier to analyze and debug. 
> Warning
> This APK contains native code, and you’ve not uploaded debug symbols. We recommend you upload a symbol file to make your crashes and ANRs easier to analyze and debug.
