> I just encountered a strange bug in iOS 15.5 and was wondering if anyone else came across it:
> The bug can be reproduced (sometime, but not hard to reproduce) by:
> 1. Long click
> 2. Drag
> 3. Wait a bit before releasing
> 4. --&gt; bug: I get an extra click event where I started the drag (even though I didn't make that click).
> It doesn't happen on safari, only on webview.
