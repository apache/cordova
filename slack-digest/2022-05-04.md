__@marek.kozela__ says 
> Hi everyone, I tried to use this plugin <https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-ionic-keyboard> in my project and with &lt;preference *name*=“KeyboardResizeMode” *value*=“native” /&gt; setup in config.xml. It seems that it is somehow working, but I also see that this plugin was not updated for long time -&gt; <https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-ionic-keyboard/issues/167>. Are you guys still using this plugin or is there a better alternative? Thanks
