__@umakhanr7__ says 
> @marek.kozela Perhaps my applications work just according to this principle, there is 1 js file that loads html, css, js and saves them using localforage, then after each opening of the application, it updates the data, and if the data has changed, it offers to reload the page. Thus, I practically do not need to release updates, except to add some kind of plugin. sorry google translate)
