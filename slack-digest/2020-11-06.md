> Have you used rich text box editor with Cordova !!  I have tried trumbowyg, ckeditor, quill...but facing different issues. If you have used any that works smoothly for windows, Android, iOS-with and without wkwebview !! ( iOS now needs special mention 😐  )

__@raphinesse__ says 
> Yesterday a colleague encountered failures to resolve `com.android.tools` dependencies from jcenter when trying to build an old cordova-android project (I think it might be cordova-android 6). I know we worked around this issue in cordova-android by preferring the google maven repo over jcenter. But I'm curious as to the actual nature of these problems. All sources I could find online talk about temporary problems with jcenter. Is that repo just so unreliable? Does anyone of you know more?
