> Hello!
> I hope you could help me.
> I had to update the OneSignal plugin, and, even though I followed all the necessary steps, it just... doesn't work.
> I got the "Could not build module OneSignal' error and 'OneSignalCore/OneSignalCore.h" not found. Has anyone got these messages? I got the ${inherited} flag in my Framework_search_paths. But I have no idea if that's what's the problem.
> Thank you for your help !
