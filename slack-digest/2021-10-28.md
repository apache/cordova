> Where do you all store your JWT's? We use SQLite but wondering if Native or local is better. <https://mannharleen.github.io/2020-03-19-handling-jwt-securely-part-1/|https://mannharleen.github.io/2020-03-19-handling-jwt-securely-part-1/>
> This recommends using cookies, which is reportedly a very bad idea on cordova. The sqlite plugin is based on websql, which has a security policy of limiting access on a per-domain basis. That is ideal but my concern is how other cordova apps are covered, particularly if they use the scheme as ours. That's what I'm trying to get more info about.

__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hi folks, is anyone here familiar with how <https://github.com/storesafe/cordova-sqlite-storage/|this sqlite plugin> enforces access to database across different apps? WebSQL has a same-origin security model that normally prevents a webpage from accessing another webpage's websql databases. So I'm curious to know how this is enforced in the cordova context given that app developers can set the webview to use a custom scheme and hostname. So if I use `<myapp://secure>` for instance, and another dev who wants to hack my app uses the same pattern for his malicious app, will his app get access to my app's databases if both are installed on a user's device?
