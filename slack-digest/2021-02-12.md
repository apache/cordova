__@norman137__ says 
> I know lots of virtualisation software doesn't work properly on M1, like Docker[1]. This will be a problem if you want to develop for Android (and use the android emulators). Google is working on building an M1 compatible emulator, but it's still in preview last I heard[2].

> There's been a few bugs reported for M1, but have a hard time finding them. I don't believe there were valid to begin with though.

__@ucheozoemena__ says

> I haven't succeeded in setting the `tools` namespace on my Cordova app's manifest file. The correct way to do this is to use the `&lt;edit-config&gt;` tag in the `config.xml`, like this:
> ```        &lt;edit-config file="app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml" mode="merge" target="/manifest"&gt;
>             &lt;manifest xmlns:tools="<http://schemas.android.com/tools>" /&gt;
>         &lt;/edit-config&gt;```
> . I then use it to modify a `&lt;uses-permission&gt;` tag like this:
> ```        &lt;config-file parent="/manifest" target="app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml" &gt;
>             &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" tools:node="replace" /&gt;
>         &lt;/config-file&gt;```
> But I keep getting this error:
> &gt; The prefix "tools" for attribute "tools:node" associated with an element type "uses-permission" is not bound.
> Any ideas for how to do this? Thanks a lot in advance.
