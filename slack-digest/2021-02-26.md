> Not Cordova related but I have a problem with the iOS Simulator running the Beta version of iOS 14.5 (18E5154g)
> I do not have access to the internet at all. Even in Safari I can not open any website.
> I tried to reset the simulator, allowing HTTPS servies in the developer options and turning off and on WIFI but nothing worked.
> The simulator with iOS 14.4 works fine
> Is someone using the new simulator or has an idea what I can try?
