__@patel.aakash__ says 
> I recently upgraded my application from Angular 10.0.14 and Cordova 9.0 to Angular 12.2.16 and Cordova 11.0. As a part of the upgrade I had to update few other dependencies to be able to make it work with the newer versions. After the upgrade I have started seeing some discrepancies in the UI of the app(details in the pictures below).
