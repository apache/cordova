__@dharmon__ says 
> Does anyone have experience with cordova-plugin-ionic-webview? I am having an issue where a callback url is not woking in ios but is working in android just fine. Basically, go to do a login, (which redirects to Auth0 login page), after a successful login, this page redirects back to `localhost` which works fine for Android, but on ios this brings me back to the first screen before login.

__@dharmon__ says 
> Anyone have any thoughts on what might be happening?
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:33:19 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that Android uses a `http`  scheme, while ios uses some other scheme (`ionic://`) by default? One of my apps uses the ionic webview, but we don't have an auth0 login page flow, so I'm not really sure.
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:34:15 GMT

__@dharmon__ says 
> Hm, yea, that was one of my thoughts, but I can't set the ios value to `http` unfortunately since it is not allowed by the plugin.
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:35:19 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Yah, that limitation comes from iOS itself.

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:36:35 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Are you sure the url is whitelisted? <https://auth0.com/docs/users/redirect-users-after-login#redirect-users-to-whitelisted-callback-urls>

__@dharmon__ says 
> I replaced `cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview` with `cordova-plugin-ionic-webview` so not sure what they do differently.

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:37:23 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:38:36 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> ionic webview will however make the ios webview use wkwebview, and I think by default it uses schemes.

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:38:41 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:39:00 GMT

__@daviesd__ says

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:39:04 GMT

__@norman137__ says

__@daviesd__ says

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:39:53 GMT

__@dharmon__ says

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:40:28 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> So you are just talking about while you are developing on the desktop, that you are having issues.  not on the device?

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:40:48 GMT

__@dharmon__ says 
> No, it is only ios that is having the URI redirect issue

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:40:56 GMT

__@dharmon__ says 
> web &amp; android work fine

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:41:43 GMT

__@dharmon__ says 
> This is how I have the customurlscheme plugin configured:

> ```&lt;plugin name="cordova-plugin-customurlscheme" spec="^5.0.2"&gt;
>     &lt;variable name="URL_SCHEME" value="com.peoplenetonline.driveui" /&gt;

> &lt;/plugin&gt;```

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:43:35 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> so your redirect_uri looks like "com.peoplenetonline.driveui://"?
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:44:35 GMT

__@dharmon__ says 
> This is the Auth0 url: `redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost&amp;nonce=9R-HujfAZuetGVOZ-CeaypHcwDYz83Ky&amp;auth0Client=eyJuYW1lIjoiYXV0aDAuanMiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoiOC4yLjAifQ%3D%3D`

__@dharmon__ says

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:45:03 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> oh, that won't work... on desktop it will... but your redirect_uri on ios device needs to be your URL_SCHEME above
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:45:26 GMT

__@dharmon__ says 
> I wonder why it worked before adding the ionic-webview
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:45:51 GMT

__@dharmon__ says 
> I know we were using the old UIwebview on ios before, that might be the reason?
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:45:56 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> most oauth2 implementations allow you to put multiple url patterns to match.... ios isn't running a localhost server I don't think... maybe the old webview implementation did?
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:46:24 GMT

__@dharmon__ says 
> That is the only thing I can think of.
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:46:42 GMT

__@dharmon__ says 
> Do you know what the multiple url pattern match looks like or where the docs are for that?
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:47:15 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> depends on what oauth2 implementation you are using... ours is homebrewed, but we follow the spec... let me find that
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:50:11 GMT

__@dharmon__ says 
> That I don't know much about or even how to figure that out. I do know we are using Auth0 lock for the UI login part of things.
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:52:12 GMT

__@dharmon__ says 
> So the default from ios for the ionic-webview should be: `<ionic://localhost>`?
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:53:05 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> Looks like you want to look at the "Allowed Callback URLs" <https://auth0.com/docs/users/redirect-users-after-login>
> For iOS you want to redirect back to your URL_SCHEME you've defined (if you are using the custom url scheme plugin)
> Sounds like Ionic is also providing a mechanism to tap into?  I haven't used it.
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:54:30 GMT

__@dharmon__ says 
> so it looks like I have a section for adding those `allowed callback URLs` in the auth0 dashboard. Looks like I can add multiples there.
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:54:39 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Yah, I believe if the `redirect_uri`  looks something like `ionic%3A%2F%2Flocalhost ...` then it should work for iOS, but obviously break for android/web. You'd have to figure out how you can programmatically choose the callback url, depending on the environment you're running in.
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:55:31 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> And yes, you'd also have to make sure the url for the callback is in the allowed list
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:55:37 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> We set these at runtime
> ```config.REDIRECT_URI = "<digby://redirect>"
> if (inBrowser) {
>     config.REDIRECT_URI = "<http://localhost:8000/redirect.html>"
> }```
> 
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:56:05 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> then we have localhost and digby:// in the allowed redirect uris list
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:56:48 GMT

__@dharmon__ says 
> so you need to allow them, but also programmatically handle them based on the environment?
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:56:55 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> yes
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:57:13 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> and i'm not sure you need the custom url scheme plugin if ionic is already handling this
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:57:20 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> unless you were using it for something else
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:58:23 GMT

__@dharmon__ says 
> That is a good question. It is an old app and I did not add that plugin, so it could easily be a case where it was useful before, but really isn't needed anymore.
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:59:10 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> oauth2 is the most complex part of our app. lol.
> 

Thu, 27 Aug 2020 17:15:51 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Does anybody know if this requires immediate attention, or can I just generate new certificates when I'm ready to work on my ios apps? Like is there any severe consequences if I don't deal with this before the certs expire?
