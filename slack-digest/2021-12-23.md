> *cordova-plugin-inappbrowser: postMessage API*
> I have a question regarding the `cordova-plugin-inappbrowser` and hope that someone in this channel has experience with it. The postMessage API has been implemented (<https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/pull/362|#362>) and is documented here: <https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser>
> 
> _What have I tried to do?_
> I was only able to find documentation for the direction from inside the inAppBrowser window to the context running the inAppBrowser - most of the case the native/cordova app (i.e. inside -&gt; outside). Is it also possible to send a message from the outside to the inside. Basically, in the same direction that `executeScript()` and `injectCSS()`work.
> 
> _What would I like to achieve?_
> Currently, I’m launch the inAppBrowser, navigate to a specific URL which is also under my control on which I have registered an event handler `window.addEventListener("message",...)`. Now, I would like to post a message from the app code to the inAppBrowser instance (i.e. the browser window that is on this specific url) once an event happens on the native device. Is this possible?

> I would be happy to contribute back and improve the official documentation if we managed to find an answer to the question. Thanks!
