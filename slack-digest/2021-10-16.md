__@norman137__ says 
> @lkslokesh25 there is no server for the android or electron platform, as the sources are bundled locally with the app. The browser platform does provide a test server because traditional browser environments are expected to be communicating with a web server for all of it's assets.

__@jacobsgur__ says 
> @dpogue Thanks. Iâ€™m very happy with Cordova overall, and have a lot invested in my existing Cordova app. I can understand why developers would start new apps with React Native.

__@dpogue__ says 
> Microsoft is dropping support for Cordova projects in their AppCenter platform

Fri, 15 Oct 2021 18:05:43 GMT

__@jacobsgur__ says 
> Right. I removed Code Push from my app in early 2021, because Microsoft had been neglecting it for a while. It was clear they werenâ€™t interested in this platform.

__@dpogue__ says 
> yeah, CodePush was pretty unmaintained and had a major security flaw for a while ðŸ˜•

__@jacobsgur__ says 
> Any thoughts on Capacitor in contrast to Cordova? Are people here all using pure Cordova?

Fri, 15 Oct 2021 18:22:56 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> I've used both, I see them as two slightly different approaches to a similar end result

__@dpogue__ says 
> Cordova should be used as a packaging tool: It generates native projects as build artifacts, but those are meant to be blown away
> 

Fri, 15 Oct 2021 18:24:34 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> Capacitor treats the native projects as part of your project, so it allows for easier native dev integration

__@jacobsgur__ says 
> I had thought Cordovaâ€™s disposable native projects makes upgrades easier? It hides the complexity of upgrading native sdks. Am I misunderstanding?

__@jacobsgur__ says 
> at the expense of waiting for Cordova to support SDK changes.

Fri, 15 Oct 2021 18:28:47 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> to some extent, yeah... although typically there aren't massive changes needed for upgrading

__@dpogue__ says

Fri, 15 Oct 2021 18:43:32 GMT

__@jacobsgur__ says 
> Well, an example of the waiting, is that Arctic Fox is not yet supported? I guess what youâ€™re saying is that Capacitor doesnâ€™t care what Android Studio or SDK version you use?
> 

Fri, 15 Oct 2021 18:48:16 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> As far as I know, projects from both Cordova and Capacitor should be able to opened in latest versions of Android Studio. You might have to use the build tools for a specific SDK version, but that's a slightly different issue
> 

Fri, 15 Oct 2021 18:49:20 GMT

__@jacobsgur__ says 
> Ok, thanks. I havenâ€™t tried. Just starting to look at updating my mobile app for the first time in 6 months.
> 

Fri, 15 Oct 2021 21:32:07 GMT

__@jcesarmobile__ says 
> In Cordova you shouldnâ€™t care about the android studio version since you build from the cli, and capacitor should work on latest version (and some previous versions too)

__@mathewp.94__ says 
> Is anyone aware of alternatives to codepush?
> Or alternative ways to distribute app binaries?
> Sharing APKs is easy enough but .ipa files can't install onto devices directly right?
