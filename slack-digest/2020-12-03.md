__@pratiksha.bhavsar0895__ says 
> Why :active and :focus css does not work on iphone ? The same css properly works on android. What could be a proper solution so that on active or on focus I can add css on my buttons. Tried ontouchstart on body as well as button tag but didn't work . Please let me know if anybody has gone through this while doing mobile app development. Thanks and Kind Regards,Pratiksha

> according to the safari docs, `:active` is only enabled on elements with a touchstart on the element.

> &gt;  On iOS, mouse events are sent so quickly that the down or active state is never received. Therefore, the `:active` pseudo state is triggered only when there is a touch event set on the HTML element—for example, when `ontouchstart` is set on the element as follows:

__@norman137__ says

> There is only 1 workaround that I know of and that's to use the native http libraries, which aren't bound to the restrictions set fourth by the webview. This would involve creating a cordova plugin or finding an existing one that provides an interface to use the native APIs instead of the JS's `XMLHttpRequest` class. The drawback of this method is that you can't use the web inspector to see those network requests and debug/troubleshoot. And transferring data across the cordova bridge is incredibly inefficient, so if you make requests that results in large data being transferred, you will receive a performance penalty with this approach.

__@norman137__ says 
> I think the moment they add the header, it will block all cross-origin request (from CORS-enabled browsers) unless if the origin is in the allowed origin header. If they want to just allow all origin, they can use `*` wildcard or dynamically read the request `Origin` header and set that as the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response.

__@norman137__ says
