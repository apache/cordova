> Hello, everyone!
> 
> Has someone expirienced working with SMS codes for iOS/Android?
> Like when you have focused input on page and sms comes, you have a suggestion 'From Messages -  9912' on your Keyboard, which will paste numbers from otp-sms, for example.
> Is there some event for this, that i can use in React and get SMS object ? Or, combination of events, which will capture everything during this process, line onkeypress + smth? (clipBoards event doesnt work here)
> or, maybe good sms cordova plugin, that doesnt require any permission (preferably) to read sms body, so i can destructure it and so on ?
> (my otp SMS dont have spicific formatting and i would like not to change anything)
> 
> EDIT: I have 4 separate inputs (for each digit), thats why i want to get whole sms object and then destructure it myself

> @erisu @norman137 I see you approved the changes and merge this PR, do you know something about that? Iâ€™m currently having the same problem and update to android 9.1 does not fix it.

__@norman137__ says 
> I don't quite remember but **during** launch, we don't have control (that's before app code actually executes). That PR addresses an issue after the app is launched.
