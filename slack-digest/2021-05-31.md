__@erikyuzwa__ says 
> hey everyone - tried to use the search but I'm upgrading our app from `ios5` to `ios6`. I think I have every base covered except for handling the download of a zip file. We've been reliant on `cordova-plugin-file-downloader` in order to show a progress bar but it's definitely not `ios6` compatible. Any suggestions? Totally appreciate any input.
