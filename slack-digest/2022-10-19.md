Tue, 18 Oct 2022 14:53:17 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> Personally, I understand that exposing the WKWebViewConfiguration is something people need, but I'm also not loving exposing WebKit internal classes as part of API... this bit us before with the UIWebView transition because we had UIWebView classes in our API and apps were getting rejected for having any references to those classes. This also ends up feeling like non-WKWebView webviews (of which I'm not sure we have any on iOS? Maybe a 3rd-party UIWebView fallback plugin?) become second-class citizens, because we're definitely not going to expose their configuration details as part of our API. I don't have a better suggestion, but ugh ðŸ˜ž

__@ulimetic__ says

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 15:07:48 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Yah I'm not sure if there is a way around that.
> 
> I mean generally speaking, in my projects I try to decouple against SDKs or APIs by creating an abstraction/interface to the SDK so that in theory the SDK/API can be swapped out for another implementation if required without changing the public interface that the application consumes itself, but that works best if you have well defined target. If Cordova would do something like that, they would have to implement the entire API to pass through to the underlying API to remain flexible which would be quite a task. Additionally in practice, those abstractions may not be enough too, as the UIWebview -&gt; WKWebView example, pretty sure the API changed quite drastically and there still can be breaking changes involved.

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 15:20:06 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> UIWebView still exists, and for enterprise apps not being distributed through the app store it remains an option. There's a community-maintained UIWebView plugin for cordova-ios via our pluggable webview API.
> Now that plug-in is going to need to implement a method that takes a WKWebViewConfiguration value because we've baked that in to our plug-in API.
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 15:26:26 GMT

__@ulimetic__ says 
> Why support it? It's been deprecated... People building enterprise apps need to upgrade to non deprecated WKWebView, simple as that
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 15:27:18 GMT

__@ulimetic__ says 
> Apple refuses submission and it's been deprecated, I don't see why this should still be supported
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 15:58:34 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> What dpogue is talking about is that Enterprise users don't go through Apple submission, it's completely ad-hoc/in-house. The enterprise distributes devices to their staff/employees, which are linked to an Apple enterprise account and they have their own distribution system. The app distribution is nearly isolated from Apple, the only enforcement is that the ad-hoc distributions can only be distributed to specific registered devices.
> 
> Which means as long as the APIs exist in the runtime libraries on the device, they are free to use it, even if they are otherwise deprecated/banned for use on the App store.
> 
> But, in my personal views, I generally agree. Cordova should focus on app developers with the intent of distributing through the App Store. I'm fairly sure that is majority of our Cordova Users are distributing through the Apple App Store/Google Play. (although I have absolutely no stats to back that up). It doesn't mean we can't have enterprise users in mind, but they generally have very specialised requirements and most likely have the resources available to fork, develop and maintain plugins and/or changes to cover those specialised requirements.
> 
> &gt; Now that plug-in is going to need to implement a method that takes a WKWebViewConfiguration value because we've baked that in to our plug-in API.
> I think the best way to solve this concern is to implement some kind of cordova interface that by default simply interfaces with `WKWebViewConfiguration`, but the maintainers of `UIWebView` plugin can implement another object for the `UIWebView` implementation. This is kind of what I was alluding to before but I honestly don't know enough of iOS development to know if that is truly feasible.

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:04:38 GMT

__@ulimetic__ says 
> I still don't see the issue. People want to use UIWebView ? Use older version of cordova-ios . Just don't drag deprecated stuff onto newer versions...
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:08:35 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> It's not _just_ UIWebView... we have a pluggable WebView API so plugins can provide any webview they want. The stock WKWebView is just a built-in plugin that ships by default, but there are alternative WKWebView plugins too.
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:13:00 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> If that's the case, we probably **should** have our own interface to a configuration object to remove the assumption of `WKWebView`

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:16:33 GMT

__@ulimetic__ says 
> "we have a pluggable WebView API so plugins can provide any webview they want" : what other webview types are available? I don't understand this response. Do you mean another instance of webview already created ?

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:17:09 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:18:26 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Apple does have rules regarding webview implementations, but again these rules only apply to apps distributing to the Apple app store.
> 
> But enterprise users could implement their own webview implementation, for example a blink (chrome) webview and have a cordova plugin that interfaces with that webview instead of using the WKWebView
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:18:29 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> You could choose to use <https://github.com/oracle/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-file-xhr> instead of the WKWebView that ships with Cordova-iOS. Or you could chose to use <https://github.com/bpresles/cordova-plugin-uiwebview-engine>
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:19:43 GMT

__@ulimetic__ says 
> Or you could chose to use <https://github.com/bpresles/cordova-plugin-uiwebview-engine> : but why should you that's my point
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:19:47 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> Cordova provides an API, and the webview is provided by a plugin implementing that API
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:20:47 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> The plugin was created after we removed UIWebView support, so clearly some people still need that functionality. We don't maintain the plugin, it's just an implementation of the API that we provide.
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:20:56 GMT

__@ulimetic__ says 
> I understand what you are saying, but still it doesn't make sense to use another WebView that is deprecated, and <https://github.com/oracle/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-file-xhr> is not a webview, it's a layer to intercept remove calls
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:22:13 GMT

__@ulimetic__ says 
> so you are trying to support dead or unrelated stuff
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:22:14 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> oh, hmm... there's definitely some alternative WKWebView plugin implementations around
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:22:46 GMT

__@ulimetic__ says

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:22:56 GMT

__@ulimetic__ says 
> Still not a webview

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:23:19 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> The point dpogue is making is that the webview might not be a WKWebView, it could be any webview.

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:26:40 GMT

__@ulimetic__ says

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:30:28 GMT

__@ulimetic__ says

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:30:46 GMT

__@ulimetic__ says

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:31:23 GMT

__@ulimetic__ says

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:32:29 GMT

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:36:54 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> In any case, it seems like the easiest option here is to just update the API that was added in <https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/pull/1050> to take a `void*` for the configuration object instead of a `WKWebViewConfiguration*`
> Then each plugin can check if the object it received is of the correct configuration type, and pass it in

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:37:31 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Certainly an easier suggestion than mine

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:38:51 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> Since this already involves people adding their own `configuration` method overload to their ViewController, they'd be responsible for returning a configuration that matches the WebView they are actually using
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:40:40 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Yah, I generaly don't like `void*` but in this case, I think it's a good fit. Allows them to directly use their webview API.
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:41:46 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> And with my proposed solution, it will be easy to accidental add bad assumptions in the interface approach, which your solution will completely eliminate since there is no intermediate interface.
> 

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:42:55 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> yeah... `void*` is kinda terrible, but it's easy, and sometimes when people ask for a footgun you just need to give them a footgun and make them responsible for the results

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:43:21 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> yup haha

Tue, 18 Oct 2022 17:41:31 GMT

__@ulimetic__ says
