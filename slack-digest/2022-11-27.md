> I've noted that the `origin` header on any HTTP fetch request is `<app://localhost>`  This can be changed to something else in the config.xml, but it can't use *http* or *https* as the protocol. My server APIs (on AWS API Gateway + Lambda) don't allow any origins other than *http* or *https* for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response headers, so I've had to change them to `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` . However, this means that I can't use `credentials: 'include'` (to include cookies) when making the request, as <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#sending_a_request_with_credentials_included|the Fetch API doesn't allow that> with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` . So am I right in thinking that I can't make fetch requests from an iOS cordova app to an API that uses cookies? Or is API Gateway the problem?
