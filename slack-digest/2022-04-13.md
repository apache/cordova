__@alex678__ says 
> Hello everybody, i'm mobile developper (4 apps iOS, 4 apps Android, 1 app windows) and i see some news from 2021 (multiple sources) meaning that Cordova will maybe not be "up to date" (for last iOS/Android versions) in the future. Do you have any news about that please ? Of course, i prefer to continue to use Cordova (command line).

__@niklasmerz__ says 
> There is no official statement. I personally think Cordova will be able to keep up with Android and iOS for the future as we have some dedicated people working on int. I recently wrote about Cordova on my personal blog: <https://blog.merzlabs.com/posts/cordova-2022/>

__@alex678__ says 
> Thanks a lot for your help today, it was difficult but i succesfully build my app with the last version of Android Studio then executed on the SDK 31 simulator.   For moment there is still problem with very few plugins, but i can continue my tests to anticipate.

__@norman137__ says 
> Just to note that while my PR adds support to API 31 for the cordova android, it's only support at the core. Individual plugins themselves may require further updates to properly support API 31.

__@norman137__ says 
> seems like the plugin is looking for `./package.json`, likely based on CWD so it's expecting that your cordova project has a package.json -- which it should, but it doesn't exists.

> Cordova (as in the cordova cli version) doesn't have anything to do with android, other than a specific cli version will default to a specific cordova-android major.
> cordova-android is the cordova's android implementation, and version 9.x was built/tested for API 29, cordova-android@10.x (current latest) is built/tested against API 30.

> Currently cordova doesn't support API 31, that will come in our next major release.

Tue, 12 Apr 2022 12:31:05 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> But trying to target API 31 on cordova-android@10 usually yields actual build issues, not plugin installation issues.
> 
> My best advice is to determine where the plugin is trying to read `./package.json` and ensure that file actually exists in the location it expects it. It may involve manually chaning it's script file at `C:\Users\alex\Documents\GitHub\hooliapps\src\planningify\google\release\plugins\cordova-android-play-services-gradle-release\scripts\apply-changes.js` to add additional logging.

Tue, 12 Apr 2022 12:35:44 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> yah so, if you're changing the target sdk to 31, even after you fix that plugin issue, you'll run into build issues because API 31 requires the use of AGP (Android Gradle Plugin) 7.x - Which requires Java 11 and build tools 31.x

__@alex678__ says

Tue, 12 Apr 2022 12:43:01 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> For now it would be recommended to stick with cordova-android@10 targeting SDK 30. If you're deploying to Google Play store, then targeting SDK 30 is required.
> 
> Due to the volunteer nature of Apache projects I can't guarantee on any timelines for releases, but we do try to have required releases out to satisfy Google requirements.

Tue, 12 Apr 2022 14:05:35 GMT

__@norman137__ says
