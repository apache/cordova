> Hello, I need to change the version of a plugin dependency. Is there any way to do it other than repositioning the plugin locally with that changed library?
> The plugin is @hmscore/cordova-plugin-hms-push and i need to change the dependency id="cordova-plugin-androidx to version="3.0.0" to 1.0.2.

__@norman137__ says 
> I think you would have to fork the plugin and make the change yourself. Then you can install your fork via git, or you can `npm pack` it and install the tgz file. Alternatively you can change the hmscore plugin id and publish your fork to npm.
