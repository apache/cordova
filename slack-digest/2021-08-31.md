__@risikoruk3678__ says 
> just wondering if anyone encountered this situation as well. I stored an mp3 after downloading it from a server and converted the file:/ path to the new app:/. The problem is that if I try the new URL with app:/ in any HTML5 audio, it plays just fine but in the Media plugin I just get the "cannot use the audio file (error 1). It plays in the HTML5 audio so I assume something is wrong elsewhere..

> My cordova apps also use ReactJS, the pattern I have is I wait for the `deviceready` event before I render anything. That way all my react components can assume plugins are ready to be used. This may or may not make sense depending how heavily reliant you are on plugins.
