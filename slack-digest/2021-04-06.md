> Is there some cordova plugin to manage and detect app versions usage?
> Or i need some backend for that?
> 
> First i think of is just custom cookies, but they are always null on app start, cause web view instance is destroyed each time.
> So.... backend is must have here? (

__@norman137__ says 
> kk, so the problem is because you have two java installs (jav a8 install nad a java11) install and the java11 install is coming first so it ends up using java11 instead of java8.
> 
> Cordova requires java8 because that's what android tooling requires, so if you add `export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"` to your `~/.bashrc` file (anywheres after the `export JAVA_HOME="..."` line) and start a new terminal session, that should make cordova happy.

__@norman137__ says 
> If you have other non-cordova related things that needs java11, you're gunna have to get creative with your environment.... on the bright site... Android tooling is suppose to support java11 soon....

> I'm having an ongoing problem.

> My app (I Grow Chicken) in the Google Play Store doesn't show when searched for on an Android 11 device.

> I have built an empty Cordova app (the base app that is generated by cordova create MyApp) and uploaded it to my internal test track.

> It is visible to Android 10 and lower but it, like the I Grow Chicken app, is also invisible to owners of Android 11 devices.
