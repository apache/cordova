__@dpogue__ says 
> So with iOS 14 enabling ITP, it looks like we might be able to avoid first-party storage clearing by adding our custom scheme to the list of AppBound Domains (<https://b.webkit.org/210674>) but this probably has implications for other use cases. Namely, once we've enabled AppBound Domains, it will not be possible to navigate the WKWebView to anything not on the AppBound Domain list, and it will not be possible to set cookies for non-AppBound Domains.
> 
> Overall, this still seems like a security improvement. We could permit our custom scheme and any hosts listed in `&lt;allow-navigation&gt;` directives in config.xml, but it's probably going to be a source of pain for people misusing the Cordova webview and trying to load things in InAppBrowser (whose WKWebView would also likely be restricted to only AppBound Domains).

__@pratiksha.bhavsar0895__ says 
> Hi team , has anyone faced wkwebview issue on ios 12 ? Cordova-ios:6.1.1 with default scheme &amp; hostname(<app://localhost>) . On 14 &amp; 13 its is working perfectly fine but on ios 12.3 there is a white screen &amp; on safari debugger when checked I can see all scripts are loading again &amp; again as in a loop. Also consoles that are added keeps on logging in loop. Please let me know if anybody has gone through such scenario. Thanks &amp; Kind Regards,Pratiksha

__@norman137__ says 
> on iOS all javascript execution is forcefully paused in the webview. On android, webview behaviour when in background I believe is device-dependent.
> 
> I think the way to do this is to setup a background service via a plugin, that could be managed/configured by a javascript API, but the executing code for the background would have to be native.
