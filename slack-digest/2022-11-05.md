__@chris.khong__ says 
> I have a pretty weird issue with plugin cordova-plugin-camera-preview on Samsung Galaxy A13. The taken picture looks like this, like a part of the image gets duplicated. Anyone has experienced the same or have an idea where should I look into? I have spent weeks on this issue but couldnâ€™t fix it.

> Thanks, I came to the same conclusion.
> P.S. Isn't it strange that after sending app to the background it's JS counter still works and can start playing MP3 when app is in the background? (It's kind of creepy when your phone start playing music by itself - run by one of many app in background)

__@norman137__ says 
> iOS I don't think gives you that privilege. I think it's possible to do background tasks, but they can't be done in the webview I'm pretty sure.

__@norman137__ says 
> Alternatively you can also use `build.json` to set the `packageType` so you don't need to specify it in the CLI arguments. Examples can be found on <https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/11.x/guide/platforms/android/index.html#using-buildjson>
