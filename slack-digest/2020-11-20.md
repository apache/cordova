__@mathewp.94__ says 
> Hello folks,
> I've got a cordova app wrapping a Vue app, and I want to deeplink into it.
> What's the best approach for this?
> I want to be able to link only on specific urls, for example `<http://www.myApp.com/product/*|www.myApp.com/product/*>`
> I've seen <https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-app-scope> in this channel but that appears to link into specific HTML files, and not pass any via a JS api.

> Do I need to use one of the 100s of forks of the `cordova-universal-links-plugin` ?

__@dpogue__ says 
> It's not possible to use both at the same time. There are tools (including some Cordova plugins) that will automatically rewrite your code to use AndroidX at build time

__@dpogue__ says 
> We're throwing around some ideas about how Cordova can deal with this, since it seems like Google might be pushing harder to use the AndroidX WebView going forward. But making Cordova depend on AndroidX would break all existing plugins that rely on the support library.

__@joel__ says

__@mathewp.94__ says

Thu, 19 Nov 2020 22:59:35 GMT

__@mathewp.94__ says

__@dpogue__ says
