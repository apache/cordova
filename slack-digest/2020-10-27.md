__@osaintilien55__ says 
> So I have been working on this for a while now(months), and I'm just now  understanding the value of React and also the spa method. I am considering trying react  but I don't think my app can really be spa because of how big it's going to be. Here is a screen recording of what I have so far (excuse the bugginess). Do you think I can use react in my app? I just ask because although I know it's good to know, would hate to find out after spending much time learning it, I can't really use it for this particular project.  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl-1Rn-Sl6Y>

__@norman137__ says 
> I use react web with my cordova projects, and my apps are quite large...

> - Uses JWT authentication token with a short-life access token, and a long-life renew token setup.
> Another one of my apps is smaller (that is the UI is very simple) but it does a lot of work. It analyses road roughness by collecting acceleration points while you drive. It needs to poll at a rather high frequency, so after recording for a few hours I have about 50-100MB of json data recorded.

> Hi guys!
> New to the electron family and I have two problems I need to address.
> We have an ionic app that runs on Android, iOS and Windows and we want to add electron to it to support other platforms.
> 
> First problem is that some of our css files point to images in the asset folder using the '/' root directory starting point  (ie: /assets/img/image.png)
> Problem is that in electron this resolves to C:/ on windows for some reason!
> Any idea how to fix this?
> 
> Second problem is that app icons don't seem to be copied in the resulting build even with the correct settings in config.xml.
