> Hey folks, I'm having some issues getting the durations of videos stored on devices running Android 11.
> I've been using this type of code:
> ```            int dataColumn = cursor
>                     .getColumnIndex(MediaStore.Files.FileColumns.DATA);
>             String path = cursor.getString(dataColumn);

>             MediaMetadataRetriever retriever = new MediaMetadataRetriever();
>             File file = new File(path);
>             retriever.setDataSource(context, Uri.fromFile(file));
>             boolean hasVideo = retriever.extractMetadata(MediaMetadataRetriever.METADATA_KEY_HAS_VIDEO).equals("yes");
>             String time = retriever.extractMetadata(MediaMetadataRetriever.METADATA_KEY_DURATION);
>             int duration = 0;
>             if (time != null &amp;&amp; hasVideo) {
>                 duration = (int) Math.ceil(Integer.parseInt(time) / 1000);
>             }```
> This was working until I began to target Android 11 (API level 30) in my app. Now the duration is always reported as `0`. I can see that `MediaStore.Files.FileColumns.DATA` was <https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore.MediaColumns#DATA|deprecated beginning with Android 10 (API level 29)>, and `ContentResolver.openFileDescriptor` is the recommended alternative. However, I don't know how to get a video's duration from a `ParcelFileDescriptor` or `FileDescriptor`. I also haven't been able to find resources that demonstrate how to do so. So, how can I do that?

> I've also tried other possible solutions, none of which have worked:
> - Using `retriever.setDataSource(file.getAbsolutePath())` instead of `retriever.setDataSource(context, Uri.fromFile(file))`. I saw that <https://stackoverflow.com/a/61336282/7987987|here> and <https://stackoverflow.com/a/42250183/7987987|here>, so I tried it but it didn't work (the duration is still zero)
> - I tried querying the duration field directly from the `MediaStore` but it still didn't work. This was the code I used:
> ```                            int vidDurationColumn = cursor.getColumnIndex(MediaStore.Video.Media.DURATION);
>                             int duration = (int)cursor.getInt(vidDurationColumn);```
> So yeah, I'm open to any ideas that work. Thanks!
