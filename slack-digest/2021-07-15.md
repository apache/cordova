I am willing to contribute a meaningful amount to that cause, to then store and index for fast searching and reference which we will also do for the whole of the Cordova community. First we need to see what Slack will charge for that by having an admin email in and ask (mention the <http://cordova.slack.com|cordova.slack.com> channel name).

__@tomkinson__ says 
> Unless this room removes inactive accounts but not sure why it would. She said just active accounts will cost (inside a 30 day period) and that a group can buy it for one month, unlock all msgs, and then not pay the month after. So it mostly is determined on how many of the 4466 are deemed active to know the cost to do this.
