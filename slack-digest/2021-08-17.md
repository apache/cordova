> Hi,
> I am trying to add support to universal links and experimenting with <https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-universal-links-plugin> (it is archived and will switch to a fork of this repo <https://github.com/GEDYSIntraWare/cordova-universal-links-plugin>).
> Most of the functionality seems to work, but the usecase of redirection to App/Play store when app is not installed, doesn't work
> Any clues where/how to look for the cause.
