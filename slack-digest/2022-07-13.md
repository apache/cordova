> hey all, does anyone know if there is a way to get the real user agent for the device, or if not, the iOS version and  device name in a variable?

> i'm trying to figure out what version of iOS my customers are using, and the user agent is coming in as `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/15E148` no matter the device or iOS version

__@norman137__ says

__@jessica__ says 
> Hm, i didn't build this app personally but I am in charge of its development now. I just searched the codebase for `OverrideUserAgent` and didn't find it.. what file would that normally be in?

__@jcesarmobile__ says
