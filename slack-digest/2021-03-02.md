> Hello!  I am trying to use the file plugin, but for some reason there is nowhere documented how to add already downloaded files on my computer and store them manualy inside cordova' s app directory. Anyone knows how to do that ?

__@tomkinson__ says 
> Anyone experienced slow app init time on slightly older devices? Our app used to open quite fast on old devices (and on a Note 20 Ultra is 3-4 sec). We've since had a few monolith files in MVC grow, we're in SPA, and we thought it was all the plugins causing it, needing to be parsed before device ready. However even after removing all the plugins we still had 8 to 10 seconds before device ready was fired. Any leading culperates?

> If you removed plugins then that only leaves javascript that being parsed/ran on startup.... Have you use the performance audit tools? Might point to where potential bottlenecks are.

> If the app is not installed, it properly redirects the browser to the app store/url provided.  If the app is installed, the user has the option to “cancel” or “open”.  Is there a way to detect if “cancel” was clicked?

__@dpogue__ says 
> no, IIRC that "open/cancel" prompt is non-blocking too, so your setTimeout will fire while it's showing

__@mattwenner1__ says 
> ahh ok, that sounds right based on the behavior I’m seeing then.  Any other good methods for detecting if an app is installed without implementing Universal Links?

__@dpogue__ says 
> Nope, Apple specifically considers it a privacy concern to be able to detect from a website if an app is installed

__@mattwenner1__ says 
> Ohh, got ya.  Good to know, that explains why all the solutions I see feel hacky and keep failing 🙂

__@marshall__ says 
> Anyone ever have a user unable to download an app from the Google Play Store? We have a user on the latest Android OS on a Samsung Note 10+ that is getting the “Can’t download this app” message from the Play store. She has followed all the suggestions from the article the play store linked her to, but still can’t download. We have hundreds of other Note 10+ users who have been able to download and use the app. Any ideas?
