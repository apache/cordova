__@harel.mazor__ says 
> I don't install anything related to npm globally, I think it's a sure way to get things corrupted.
> I think the right way to do this is installing locally and create a script in the package.json file.
> If you need something that is not in the package.json file use `npx`.
> I've tested this a lot with both angular and cordova. It works.
> This is especially important if you have branches with different version or you are thinking about upgrading cordova and you want to do it in a branch etc.
> I can't stress this enough... Don't use global installation...
