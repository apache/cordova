__@norman137__ says 
> When does it freeze? Most of the time app freezing is the result of the phone providing you a large resolution image and you using the `DATA_URL` method that needs to base64 a rather large binary file.

__@dan590__ says 
> Hi, just a quick question. Which Gradle version I should use with Cordova?  I think I used version `5` previously but recently changed to version `6` . It worked fine initially but now I got Gradle errors when running `cordova build android` . So im wondering if this has anything to do with the version and if there is a definitive version Cordova/cordova-android is expecting.

__@lwishartcraig__ says 
> Hey - shot in the dark, but does anyone have any advice to get the InAppBrowser to launch on iPad (iOS 13)? Currently, our usage is `InAppBrowser.open('<https://example.com/>', '_blank', 'location=no')` which opens the page in Safari. On iPhones and Android, it works as normal, opening in the InAppBrowser view.

__@fabry.levente__ says 
> Hello, I need to fix some of our custom plugin and it used the CDVURLProtocol, but now in ios 6 it's deprecated. Is there any alternative to replace it? I found the CDVURLSchemeHandler looks similar but if I import it, it's not working because the CDVURLSchemeHandler.h is not found. Can somebody help? Thanks in advance

__@ivan.harpley__ says 
> Hi everyone. What is the best practice to remove a plugin from a single platform? I need to use the `cordova-plugin-file` plugin for all platforms except the browser. However, when I run the app in the browser, I'm prompted to allow permission to write to storage. I tried using Plugman, but it doesn't support the browser platform. I also tried simply editing the `plugins/browser.js` file, but running `cordova platform add browser` adds `cordova-plugin-file` back as a dependency. Any advice?

__@jordi289__ says 
> Yeah, i've been playing around with the tray icon. It caused crashes on startup for ubuntu before. But I think it's sorted now, might try a few other options for the tray icon. I also came across something to do with the nightly build clashing with a chromium build. But need some extra debugging today to see if that is the fix. I'll send an update if I get it sorted

> I just tried booting it from the raspberry pi manually (something we never do, since we normally have these devices on locations), and it just started the program. So our solution is to just reboot the device the moment I'm done updating our program and then just make a startup script which starts the device.

__@jordi289__ says 
> Also, one more question. Is it possible to change the name of the build folder which is getting generated by the `cordova build electron` command. Right now it's something like: `application-1.0.0-armv7l`, is it possible to change it to something like `application-armv7l` ?
