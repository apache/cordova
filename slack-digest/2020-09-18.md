__@pratiksha.bhavsar0895__ says 
> Hi team I have a scenario where there is a sdk which needs to integrated in native app (supposingly in mycordovaApp/platforms/android..) and the base app is pure cordova app (mycordovaApp) . Is there a way to set up communication from native code to js code &amp; viceversa . Even if there is a way fortunately will there be any performance impact ? As the sdk is only available for native code &amp; our main code base is in cordova. Can u help me with some suggestions ? Thanks &amp; Regards,Pratiksha
