__@joel__ says 
> Is anyone seeing unexpected clipboard access notifications on iOS 14?  What does it even mean to "paste from Safari"?  Our app does copy to the clipboard, but it doesn't paste *from* the clipboard, unless the user is doing it themselves, in which case I wouldn't expect a message.  But I think we're seeing it without any corresponding user action.

__@joel__ says 
> Right .... I'm just saying that I can't explain *how* it's reading from the Clipboard.  The reports we are getting do not correspond to a user initiated clipboard paste - i.e.: they copy text from Safari and past that text into our app.  Like I said, our app is not (to my knowledge) imperatively reading or scanning the contents of the clipboard.  It could be a plugin.  Another thought I had is that is that this is some side effect of WKWebView.  Have you tested your apps on iOS 14?  If so, are you seeing this?

__@joel__ says 
> I haven't tested it myself yet either, just going on reports, but I don't think this toast is being displayed as a result of the user copying something *to* the clipboard.  And if it was, wouldn't it be pretty confusing to say "pasted from Safari" when copying text to the clipboard?

__@norman137__ says 
> Yah the terminology is kinda confusing, but it's saying "Safari" the app is pasting the clipboard to another app, which I guess linguistically is the same as saying the app is copying the clipboard from safari. And I don't think this toast notification will popup if the user is actaully using the system UI to manage the clipboard. Based on the article, it's saying the goal is to provide transparency to the user when an app copies from the clipboard without the user necessarily knowing.

__@joel__ says
