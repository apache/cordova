__@francois259__ says 
> Hi, I am trying to make a Cordova plugin to integrate an android library in a Cordova app (This one: <https://github.com/iadvize/iadvize-android-sdk>).
> I managed to make this iadvize sdk initialize itself (console logs looks ok). But the Cordova app only displays the web view.
> The problem is: this library is supposed to display a chat interface but I don't know how to display this native interface at the same time as the Cordova web view.
> Does anyone have documentation or an example or could help me with this?
