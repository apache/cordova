__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hey folks, has anyone had problems with videos only playing audio in their app? So the video only shows the image I specify using the `poster` attribute, even while the audio is playing. For me this happens with videos I record with my device. For videos downloaded from elsewhere or even recorded by another app on the device (eg Mobizen), both video and audio play properly without problems. From what I've read it appears this is a problem with encoding and/or missing codecs, but I'd like some input or suggestions about how to resolve it. My app gives users the ability to access media in their gallery so asking the user to modify their own vidoes just to be used in my app isn't an ideal situation.
