> Hi folks, is it possible to set the opacity of the Android web view itself, perhaps via a `&lt;preference&gt;` element in the `config.xml`, or via a plugin? I’m using the ionic-webview plugin but the docs don’t indicate that such a thing is possible.

> Hello everybody, I like to ask one more question.
> My app ask for permission to use Location  but if I click yes it will not turn on the Location, so I have to enable the Location manualy, after that its workin. I like to ask if its possible with Cordova to have popup dialog which will not only give permission to the app to use Location but also turn the Location on on the phone. As for example Google.maps app use. thank you
