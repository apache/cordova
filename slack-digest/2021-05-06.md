__@thiago.freitas__ says 
> Hi, i'm having issues uploading an app to App Store.
> I'm using Xcode 11.7 and MacOs 10.15
> 
> It says that i need to build the app using SDK for IOS 14, and it comes with Xcode 12.
> After getting that, i tried the commom solution that consists in copying the 14.0 folder from some repo and pasting it on the correct Xcode folder.
> 
> But i still get the same error, i didn't want to update Xcode now(because i'll need to update the MacOs too).
> 
> If i got it right, the device support files, are only if i want to simulate on a real device that has IOS 14, for example, am i right?
> 
> Someone can help me?
