__@timkremer__ says 
> Hi all, i'm trying to work out how to sign a cordova-electron Windows build. The documentation mentions setting 'String path to the certificate file'. However it doesn't say what format that certificate file should be. 
> Is it pfx?
> Is there a specific set of steps to export the certificate from Windows certificate store to be in a compliant format?
> 
> Thank you!
> 
> As general feedback, i don't know which windows packaging/signing tool is being used behind the scenes to achieve cordova's functionality, which makes looking for additional documentation difficult. Electron's site seems to list 3+ windows build packages.
> Thanks again :)
