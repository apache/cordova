__@reis__ says 
> hey guys, I'm stuck on an issue related `CORS`.  Recently the app was updated to use `WKWebView` and the `CORS` was implemented on my BE side. But I have a feature where the app needs to connect with a local device (a sensor like an arduino) . And his BE is not be reached to implement the CORS. I'm trying a lot of things, my research appoint to the use of native code to do this requests is the best way, for now I'm trying to use this plugin:  <https://github.com/silkimen/cordova-plugin-advanced-http>
> with he I get to made others requests but not this local request.

__@norman137__ says 
> From the screenshot it looks like you're still using `XMLHttpRequest` from the webview and not a http plugin. And the ios webview  expects the server to implement CORS which it is incorrectly doing so.

__@reis__ says

__@reis__ says 
> well forgetting the screenshot, (I not should've sent him, just wanted to confirm the CORS issue). About this issue have any idea of how can I solve? my research say that is not more possible  bypass the the CORS using XMLHttpRequest, in this case I'll need to make this request using native code, right? If yes, you know something about this plugin above with this kind of request, or recommend another think?

__@timbru__ says 
> Why is using cors not an option?
> 

Tue, 27 Oct 2020 15:26:00 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Using the native http api will allow you to bypass cors because cors is not enforced in the native layer, it's only enforced in the browser. But routing all your connections through the cordova bridge to do this isn't going to be very efficient, especially when it comes to binary data; so it might not be a solution for everyone. As annoying as CORS is to deal with, it's always best to stay within the webview realm as much as possible.
> 
> And you shouldn't need to go through that trouble if the server just implements CORS properly. I can't tell you exactly what is wrong without seeing code/your API responses, but the error stated the preflight request failed to respond, so that hints where to look:
> 
> - Ensure that you're server responds to the `OPTIONS` http method on your URL endpoint
> - Ensure that the `OPTIONS` http method response includes the necessary Access-Control headers.
> - Use <https://www.postman.com/|postman> to hit your server, which makes testing your URL end points easier.
> The only reason that someone should bypass CORS imo, is because they don't have control over the BE and they don't have the resources to setup and run a proxy server.

__@osaintilien55__ says 
> I did "run android" command yesterday or maybe 2 days ago and it was working just fine on my phone, but now it's not. The app apk can play in my bluestacks emulator but it won't start on my phone. I can see my phone in chrome inspect. I have already tried platform remove and platform add to start fresh. Not sure what else could be the problem. I am trying to get it on my phone so that I can troubleshoot some issues with remote.

__@norman137__ says
