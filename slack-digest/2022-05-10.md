__@alex678__ says 
> Thx, i already have Java 11, so i will try with master version and cordova target version = 32 instead.  and also build tools 32 i think.

__@norman137__ says 
> If you use any apache maintain plugins though, feel free to open any issues related to API 31 or API 32, if there isn't already issues opened.
