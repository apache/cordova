__@mathewp.94__ says 
> This might sound an odd question, but does anyone have ideas on how I can crash my cordova android app ? I'm trying to cause exceptions using a custom plugin, but the Cordova plugin wrapper catches unhandled exceptions ðŸ˜›

__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hi folks, I'm getting build failures with this error since upgrading to cordova android 10.
> ```&gt; Task :app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac
> /Users/vagrant/git/platforms/[REDACTED]/app/src/main/java/org/apache/cordova/whitelist/WhitelistPlugin.java:25: error: cannot find symbol
> import org.apache.cordova.Whitelist;
>                          ^
>   symbol:   class Whitelist
>   location: package org.apache.cordova```
> There are other similar errors, but I don't want to copy all of them. Looks related to the whitelist plugin getting rolled into cordova-android in v10. The whitelist plugin README says the plugin should be removed for cordova android 10, but I get these errors *both* with and without the whitelist plugin Any ideas that could help? I'd really appreciate it, thanks.

__@norman137__ says

__@erisu__ says 
> Based on file path, it seems you have old files that shouldnâ€™t exist. I would also recommend what Norman suggested.

> There can also be import issues if a plugin is trying to import the whitelist class as well. For example `cordova-plugin-file-transfer` is trying to import Whitelist. This plugin has not been updated yet and will need to be.
