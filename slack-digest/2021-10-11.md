__@pawelkolodziej81__ says 
> I have implemented solution without plugin support. It handles capture scenario, allowing to take a foto and return result directly to input. For no `capture` scenario I have implemented a chooser: file/camera if there are any "image like" signatures in `accept` attribute. For "document like" scenario implementation falls back to earlier file chooser implementation.

__@norman137__ says 
> If you can precompile ejs -- then you can just incorporate the compile command into your build process, and generate the HTML output to your `www` folder, before you use the `cordova build` or `cordova run` command.

> If you need runtime compilation -- I know EJS has runtime support but I don't know how well it work in a cordova environment. Using server-based rendering isn't recommended as explained <https://cordova.slack.com/archives/C068CHRJ5/p1633876843044300?thread_ts=1633846839.032900&amp;cid=C068CHRJ5>
