__@harsh.agarwal__ says 
> I need to change the “localhost” value in this popup. I found that the ionic <https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-ionic-webview|webview> plugin will sort this issue. In order to change the localhost value we have to use this - `&lt;preference name="Hostname" value="app" /&gt;` . after change this i am able to remove the localhost from the url but now this `DeviceOrientationEvent.requestPermission` starts giving error `Call to requestPermission() failed, reason: Browsing context is not secure.` . Please help me out here.
