__@rodri.sanchez1998__ says 
> Hi guys, the guy of Cboard project its back. At final i decided to use Electron platform, instead windows. Thank you for that. Now, i have another question. I have one repository <https://github.com/cboard-org/ccboard> where explain how to setup cordova-android. I want to extend that and add cordova-electron. I made some modifications in my platform/electron/platform_www/cdv-electron-settings (a folder which doesnt exists instead you make cordova add platform electron).  The git user will decide which platform he wants to build. How can i attach the cdv-electron-setting  when the user add the platform? I would explain that in readme but i think its a wrong way to do that. Im a begginer developer, if somebody can help me i will apreciate that.

__@norman137__ says 
> You should be able to.... when a user selects a file, you'll get a `File` instance, which should contain properties like `size`, which is the size of the chosen file in bytes. You can even read the file via the `FileReader` as text or a blob and do further validations on the file format.
