> @norman137 I removed the max SDK version and that seems to have had no effect.
> 
> Notice how I edited my message above to include config.xml. It's the super-basic config.xml generated by cordova. I added the &lt;preference name="android-targetSdkVersion" value="31" /&gt;
> 
> I test the appearance of updates to the app (in Internal Test) by using various emulated devices in Android Studio. Again, the emulated Android 11 devices do see the update while the emulated Android 12 devices don't.
> 
> What if I zipped up my project and sent it to you to see if (after you've changed the identity of the app to one of your test apps) you can make it appear in the Play Store to Android 12 devices?
> 
> Meanwhile, I am going to make a new attempt with targetSdkVersion = 30
