__@hilah1999__ says 
> Hi,I'm new to all this ... I wanted to ask if anyone knows how to debug an app? Because I tried through the debug in xcode and it does not work for me, I put breake points in the code in xcode, the app opens I click on something but on the xcode there is no stopping at breake points and below I do not see the values in the variables I made breake points, I realized maybe it is related to working on a project in Cordoba .
> I would be happy if someone could help me how can debug anyway?
