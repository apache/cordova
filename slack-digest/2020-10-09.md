__@khatridevk__ says 
> `xcode 11` `cordova-ios@6.1.1` custom framework files are getting copied in 'Embedded Framework' not in 'Link Binary with Libraries'. Earlier version of Xcode added frameworks in both the section using `&lt;framework src="xxx.framework" custom="true" embed="true" /&gt;` in plugin.xml.  Do I need to do anything extra here !! have been stuck on this from some time though...ðŸ˜• Looks like I am missing some info.. have tried `&lt;source-file src="xxx.framework" target-dir="lib" framework="true" /&gt;`  as well.
