> Hi everybody, after overcoming 1284 errors I have reached the point when I finaly have cordova-plugin-geofence up and running, but the issue is that it did no send any local notifications when I enter or exit geofence area.
> 1. Plugin successfully initialize, add geofence and detect Transition of GPS with geofence - tested with custom alert
> 2. I added separately code from cordova-plugin-local-notifications to test notification - also ok
> 3. I also checked and there is Listening for geofence transitions in native code already implemented in the plugin so ithave capability of sending Local notifications
> so looks like the problem is in geofence plugin is not firing Local notification.
> <https://github.com/compelling/cordova-plugin-geofence>
> Anyone have any idea how to proceed with debugging??  I ran out of ideas
> this is the code which is used
