> Hello, I have one issue I cant find a solution for . I have a small testing app I want to add to Google Play to see the process.
> There are no plugins in App. When I do: cordova build android and upload the apk to Google there is an error saying:
> 1. You uploaded a debuggable APK or Android App Bundle. For security reasons you need to disable debugging before it can be published in Google Play....
> 2. You uploaded an APK or Android App Bundle that was signed in debug mode. You need to sign your APK or Android App Bundle in release mode
> Any idea how to solve this in Codrova environment?
