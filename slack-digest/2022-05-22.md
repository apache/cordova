> Reliability of Android Studio emulator?
> 
> I gave up on Android Studio emulator because it hates running on a machine that has Hyper-V running. Instead I installed BlueStacks.
> 
> I told it to emulate a Galaxy S10 (so simple: just a dropdown in the Device section of the settings panel) and suddenly, when I search for my app in the Play Store, it can see it!
> 
> I am checking with a physical device now (I don't have a S10, I am asking a friend) and if he says he can finally see it, I'll have to conclude that the real problem all along was the Android Studio emulator.
> 
> I'll report back when I know that for sure.
