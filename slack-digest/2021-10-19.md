__@miroslav.vojtus__ says 
> Hello all,
> we are developing cordova-ios app which needs to be integrated with MS Azure OAuth Authorization server.
> We have setup custom scheme which leads all request to have header Origin set to <scheme://localhost>.
> This is not allowed in case of mobile platform request towards Azure.
> I have confirmed with electron and manual request that removing Origin header solves the problem actuall it is also recommended by Azure at
> <https://login.microsoftonline.com/error?code=9002326>.
> 
> Is it possible to alter specfic or all request not to add Origin header?
> Alternatively do you have experience with mobile integration to MS Azure?

__@norman137__ says 
> No, the `Origin` header is added by any CORS-enabled browser and the WKWebView is a CORS-enabled webview. You may need to have a proxy, where you call on your own server, which then forwards the HTTP call to azure.
> 
> Or you can escape browser tech by doing the request in native via a cordova plugin instead of using the browser's `XMLHttpRequest` / `fetch`. Native http calls naturally aren't bounded by CORS or manipulated by the browser, so you can make a request without specifying the `Origin` request header.

__@miroslav.vojtus__ says 
> I am going to write custom plugin then. I already have one without native impl but now it seems I will write also native ðŸ™‚
> Question for me is if there is some common approach to unit testing in cordova plugins for iOS?
> Or should I go the standard way via setting up an xcode project and unit test target in the developed plugins sources?

__@mathewp.94__ says
