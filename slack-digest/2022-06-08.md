__@norman137__ says 
> if you think it requires a newer AGP, you can test it on the nightly cordova-android version, which uses AGP 7.x. It will require build tools 32 and java 11 as well

__@norman137__ says 
> Alternatively on cordova-android@10, I think you can set the AGP version using `AndroidGradlePluginVersion` preference. I don't think it's documented but is in the list of XML to gradle mappings <https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/blob/68a9a3181aae6e39d6812222087456358b8b377e/lib/prepare.js#L106>
> 
> Note that using this is more or less a feature for testing, Apache doesn't support issues when changing the AGP to a different value than it's default nor are different values are tested.
