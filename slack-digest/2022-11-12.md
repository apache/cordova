__@norman137__ says 
> Or if you're talking about the new splashscreen being supported on older android devices, Cordova-android@11 includes a compatibility library provided by Android which will effectively bring the new android splashscreen system to older API levels. There's a couple caveats with it (it doesn't always work in simulators &amp; and the branding feature is not supported by that compatibility library.
