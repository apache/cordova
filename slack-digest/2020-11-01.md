__@harel.mazor__ says 
> Hi guys. I have two unrelated questions: 
> 1. I have a PR in cordova-ios waiting to be merged and I was wondering if there's a way to expedite its merge. It's waiting for about 3 month now...
> 2. I have a small open source project that has a small income and I'm looking to pay someone for stuff related to cordova - bug fixing, small features in a plugin, etc. The idea is to return this code back to the community of course. If anyone is interested please contact me (can be though linked-in: Harel Mazor)
