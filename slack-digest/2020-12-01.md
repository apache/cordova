__@raitomakesgames__ says

Mon, 30 Nov 2020 23:56:07 GMT

__@norman137__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> File transfer plugin helps in my case because it helps keep the files outside of the webview environment. Transferring data, especially binary data across the cordova bridge (between the webview and the native land) is extremely inefficient. Base64 encoding is required and that blows up the size of the data by about 40%, when dealing with binary data.
> 
> File transfer plugin avoids those bottlenecks by doing the download/upload and the file reading/writing completely on the native side. But I have never used it on a large transfer like what you have. Like I said, 50-100mb max. But I'm pretty sure the plugin uses chunking/streams so I'm still kinda surprised to see high memory footprint if you are running into memory constraints

> Hey folks, Cordova noob here. I'm using Cordova 10 and `cordova-ios 6.1.1` When using the command `cordova run ios` my build is good and an emulator launches. However, when my app starts it stays frozen at the splash screen and no errors are outputted. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I've spent hours trying to understand what's going on
