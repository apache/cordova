> Hey everyone, I have a phonegap specific question, but I hope somebody here knows something about it ðŸ™‚ (I searched via slack search, but did not find a reply)
> 
> Google Play announced a new API limit "From 2 November 2020, app updates must target Android 10 (API level 29) or higher." <https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk.html>
> 
> Phonegap only was updated to Cordova-9.0.0, which uses Android API level 28 if I understand it correctly:
> <https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-cli/releases>
> 
> Is it still possible to use Phonegap(-cli), update to API level 29 and build it locally (via Android Studio)? Thanks very much in advance!
