> &gt; AFAIK there is no viable alternative to WKWebbView ?
> WKWebView is the only webview available on iOS. Apple does not allow apps to include their own browser rendering implementations.

> &gt; Or possibility to increase memory limit ?
> Afaik, there is no way to increase the memory limit, this is heavily governed by the OS based on available resources. There's also a hard per-app memory limit of 5GB, even if the device has well over 5GB of RAM available.

> Quick google did find an <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_kernel_increased-memory-limit?changes=latest_beta&amp;language=objc|entitlement>  that you might be able to justify using. This was only implemented in iOS 15 however. Even still, your app must still "work" without this entitlement. I have no idea if this entitlement will work with memory allocated by the webview.
