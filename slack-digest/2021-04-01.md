> I need to write a Cordova plugin for Android that uses a particular SDK.

>   private ServiceConnection mConnection;
>   private boolean isConnect = false;
> 
>   @Override
>   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
>      if(mConnection == null)
>         mConnection = new ServiceConnection() {
>             @Override
>             public void onServiceConnected(ComponentName className, IBinder service) {
>                 mService = Foo.bar(service);
>                 isConnect=true;
>             }
>         };
>     //...
>   }```
> How can I translate this to a Cordova plugin, since `onCreate` is not available in `CordovaPlugin.java` ?
