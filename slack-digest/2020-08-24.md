__@pratiksha.bhavsar0895__ says 
> Any one here facing the following issue after updating to wkwebview with cordovaios@6.1.0 &amp; adding scheme:app  &amp; hostname:localhost , got cors issue in ios but resolved from backend as in Network with each api call Origin is app:localhost while for android in Network with each api call Origin is file:// . Hence api works in ios but not in android. How do we deal with this ? Also , if we deploy app to production will be preferences stay same i.e scheme:app  &amp; hostname:localhost ? Is there any detail document on scheme &amp; hostname why and how to use it as per platform variation ?
