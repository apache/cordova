> Displaying mixed webview and native view can be very complicated depending on your requirements. If the native view can simply be overlayed on top, that should be as simple as creating a native view container and adding it to the android activity.

> If you want to make the native view appear seamless with other HTML elements, you might be able to draw inspiration from the cordova google maps plugin... <https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps#how-does-this-plugin-work-android-ios>
