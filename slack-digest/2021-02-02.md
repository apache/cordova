__@singh.amarjot__ says 
> Hello to everyone. I'm having trouble with `&lt;input type="file" /&gt;`. In particular it doesn't handle upload from google drive. It gives the error `net::ERR_UPLOAD_FILE_CHANGED` with the message _`the requested file could not be read, typically due to permission problems that have occurred after a reference to a file was acquired`_ . It happens only on android. Someone have more insights about this? Thanks
