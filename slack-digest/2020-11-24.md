__@brianra__ says 
> Quick question about the docs.  I see the current docs have 9.x marked as the *Latest*.  Is this 9.x referring to the CLI or the docs themselves?  It seems like there is more accurate documentation under *dev*, which should be the default in some cases?  For example, the SplashScreen docs has a critical pivot in the current latest versions, but that's not in the 9.x docs.

__@norman137__ says 
> it's referencing CLI 9. CLI 10 docs hasn't been released yet, so they only appear under dev.

Mon, 23 Nov 2020 22:26:57 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> At this point, I think you're better off viewing the dev version of the docs until CLI 10 docs is actually published.

__@darren.op__ says 
> We have an open source mobile app that's been working great on Android and iOS and still works great on Android but its developed a frustrating bug in iOS where when the app's first installed and opened it hangs on the first page. If you close the app and open it again it works fine from then on. No codes changed and it's fine on Android and I can't see anything obvious why it's now hanging. A couple of dev's have looked at it and drawn a blank. Does anyone want to take a look at the project on GitHub and spot what I'm missing?

__@dpogue__ says 
> This is some (long awaited) good news:
> &gt; Speaking of Safari in latest iOS 14.3 beta and local capture, `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` can now be exposed to WKWebView applications. `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` is automatically exposed if the embedding application is able to natively capture either audio or video. Please refer to Apple documentation to meet these requirements. Access to camera and microphone is gated by a user prompt similar to Safari and SafariViewController prompts. We hope to extend WKWebView APIs to allow applications to further control their camera and microphone management in future releases.

__@norman137__ says 
> The problem is the web view doesn't offer the same UI as the browser itself if I recall accurately. The android app is expected to provide their own file choosing implementation by overridding a hook method on the webview class and including every option that the normal browser provides is a bit more complicated because it involves adding/managing permissions from the framework and we can't just force all apps declare those permissions.
> 
> One would then think: "well maybe the plugin should be providing the UI implementation", and well, then you have to ask "what if there is multiple plugins that wants to handle browser file choosing?".
> 
> I think in order to solve that problem, one will probably need to create a proof of concept, then bring it up on the dev mailing list to see if it makes sense to have it implemented.
> 
> In my apps I just use the camera plugin and have my own modal to let the user decide if they want to import an existing image or use the camera.

Mon, 23 Nov 2020 13:56:40 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> The cordova framework uses a `WebChromeClient` file choosing intent, so we don't manually create the UI, we delegate that to an Intent.
> 
> In Android, Intents are used off-load a task to another app on the device. So what has changed is probably the OS version, or it's possible the device has a different file choosing app installed.
> 
> So the file choosing UI that is shown could vary by:
> - Different OS versions
> - Different device vendors
> - User installing a different app that handles that Intent.
> The majority of the cordova framework that handles this intent hasn't changed in 6 years. 15 months ago, it was updated to handle multiple file inputs.
