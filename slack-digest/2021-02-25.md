__@iliya.stambolov__ says 
> Hello! I have this weird trouble. When i build my project using npm run build i get cordova is not defined. And the weirdest thing is that it does not happen everytime. But when happens i cannot fix it. I am using a cordova plugin inside my react code. But i am loading my react code on device ready. And i have script src=cordova.js inside index.js

Wed, 24 Feb 2021 16:28:38 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> From the webview? I don't think so, as I'm pretty sure iOS will pause the webview/JS engine while the app is in the background. If you need something to run in the background, I think it requires a plugin that schedules a task. But I'm not 100% confident with this, I could be wrong.

__@iliya.stambolov__ says 
> Apple has been pretty aggressive since iOS 9 about background processing. You used to get a few minutes to do stuff. However people abused it, drained the batteries and Apple stopped it. That's why we don't have nice things anymore.
> We're aware of code that you can hijack to do background processing. So is Apple, guaranteed to get your app rejected.
> The solution to this is to use a server side push. That's what we do, send a remote notification. It's the easiest solution and costs very little. Onesignal is free.

__@dozer247__ says 
> Hi, Has anyone managed to sync their file to iCloud?   I'm saving a file to the cordova.file.documentsDirectory directory  and was hoping to see the files when i use the input="file" element.   But i can't see the saved files.  I'm unsure if i have configured my cordova app correctly.  I basically followed <https://nemecek.be/blog/6/saving-files-into-users-icloud-drive-using-filemanager> to setup icloud.  Or is there another way where i can backup some files and restore them later?

__@tomkinson__ says 
> We recently had a webview issues that caused a white flash on swipe nav. Wasn't there prior..samsung Note 20 Ultra. We backtracked apks months same issue. Although wasn't there months ago. So...OS likely. Hopefully helpful thread here. It resolved on webview uninstall (only reverts to base version). But how do you get a user to handle so they don't get any bugs, anyone know of a Webview version control or some such standardization to resolve for all versions and devices? For the record;
