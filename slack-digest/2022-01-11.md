__@javarea__ says 
> Hi, I have a problem with a cache file in ios, cache.db. Some time ago I solved this problem by adding the cordova-disable-nsurl-cache plugin. Months later the problem has reappeared, could it be that this file is present again due to the SecureStorage plugin that was recently added? Or would that plugin have no relation to the iOS cache.db file?
