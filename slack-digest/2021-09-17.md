> Hi! when trying to build a project I’m getting the following error: Could not GET ‘<https://jcenter.bintray.com/com/google/firebase/firebase-messaging/maven-metadata.xml>’. I think this is because of jcenter sunset, does anybody know how to solve this?

__@erisu__ says 
> &gt; *UPDATE*: JFrog has decided to keep JCenter as a read-only repository indefinitely. New package and versions are no longer accepted on JCenter. All Bintray services have been shutdown.
> Since there last update to the statement about keeping it up as read-only, they never updated it saying that it was decided to be completely shutdown.

__@erisu__ says 
> I was not sure where you were getting JCenter reference from too. If you were using Cordova 10.x, we removed JCenter completely.. If you still had it and was on 10.x I was going to suggest you talking to the plugin dev.

__@erisu__ says 
> All plugins now have the GH Actions workflow merged in.
> 
> Here is the run results: <https://gist.github.com/erisu/ea2ea5fd364a13e3fddb64280ebdff25>
> 
> In short, 8 plugins are passing and 7 are failing.
> 
> The failing plugins, I believe, are actual test failures and not related to the GH Action configurations.
> 
> I believe the next steps are:
> - Remove Travis CI &amp; AppVeyor configs.
>     ◦ It might be safe to remove even for the failing plugins.
> - Investigate and resolve the failing plugins.
> - Review what should be done for Chrome testing. I added the GH Actions Chrome workflow, but I do not recall if there was a discussion to deprecate the browser platform. The platform is currently not documented on the website and last release was on Feb 1, 2019.
>     ◦ If Chrome testing is removed then the results are: 10 passing &amp; 5 failing.
