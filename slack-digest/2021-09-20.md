__@g.papez__ says 
> Good morning. I’m having issues signing (windows appx or msi) when building electron app for windows.
> 
> Following the documentation (<https://github.com/apache/cordova-electron/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#windows-signing>), cert file and password should be enough. However, I’m getting the error
> ```- cannot decode PKCS 12 data using Go pure implementation, openssl will be used  error=pkcs12: unknown digest algorithm: 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1
>   ⨯ no certificates with ExtKeyUsageCodeSigning  
>   - signing         file=platforms\electron\build\MyApp 0.0.1.msi certificateFile=cert.pfx 
> Cannot extract publisher name from code signing certificate. As workaround, set win.publisherName. ```
> So I’ve did just that - I’ve appended next part to the package.json:
> ```{
>   build: {
>     win: {
>       publisherName: "exact as it is in certificate"
>     }
>   }
> }```
> And am still getting the exact same error. Can someone help me out here?
