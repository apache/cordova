__@khan.alishup__ says 
> Hello, I am trying to update some plugins our app was using. Starting with cordova-ios@6. We are currently using cordova-ios@5.1.1 with WKWebView and wkwebviewxhrfix plugin. I saw in many discussions regarding the fixes or using scheme app instead of file:// for WKURLSchemeHandler. I had tried possibly all mentioned approaches like removing WKWebView and other plugins, adding preference tags with app and localhost etc, but I am still getting the CORS error with the app stuck in splash screen. Since, iOS 15 has started deleting some data, one of the approach we are taking is updating all plugins. Sorry, for my bad explaination.

__@norman137__ says 
> If you're communicating with an external server, then you'll still receive CORS error. The server itself needs to be configured to respond with the appropriate CORS headers.
> 
> If you're communicating locally (such as using XMLHttpRequest to fetch local resources, a common pattern used in the angular framework for example) then schemes should address CORS issues.

__@norman137__ says 
> Schemes were also only implemented in cordova-ios@6 -- the wkwebview plugin itself (used in conjunction with cordova-ios@5) does not support schemes.
