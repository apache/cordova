__@norman137__ says 
> cookies is an outstanding issue with WKWebView where cookies aren't synced with the webview, at least not synchronously. This might be a workaround for the time being: <https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/issues/944#issuecomment-660035130>

__@norman137__ says 
> The thing about background services is the webview needs to live in an activity, therefore your javascript environment must be in an activity and you can't guarentee the activity will exists because the OS may kill the activity for a number of different reasons when the activity isn't in the foreground.
> 
> I know there are some apps/plugins that do incorporate background services, e.g: <https://github.com/transistorsoft/cordova-background-geolocation-lt> (they have a restrictive license, don't copy their code, unless if you know what you're doing legally). So it's definitely possible, but it's outside of my expertise.
