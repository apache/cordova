> I would try it first without AndroidX enabled, which I suspect it will work. The camera plugin does make use of the legacy support libraries still. Then add AndroidX with the adapter. If it breaks in the sample app, then I'd recommend we move this to GitHub issues[2]. It would be good to keep track of cases where the androidx adapter seems to fail. (Maybe it's because we are using v27 of the support libs instead of v28)
