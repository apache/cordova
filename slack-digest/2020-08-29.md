__@newuser9929__ says 
> Hello!
> I’m trying to wrap my existing Vue app to Cordova and getting problems with displaying images with `&lt;img v-bind:src="[getter with path to my server]"&gt;` — apparently they cannot load so alt is being shown instead (on iOS too).
> Logcat shows nothing useful
> 
> What I’ve tried:
> 1. Adjusting CSP as described <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40595787/remote-image-not-loading-in-cordova|here>
> 2. Receiving result as base64 and returning it as ``data:image/jpeg;base64,${resultBase64}`` via getter
> Initially application was packed via `vue add cordova`
> 
> So, if anyone faced this issue, it would be cool to hear a solution
> 
> Thanks!

> Hi All,
> We are building a new, visual, open-source front-end framework called <https://scalab.app|Scalab>. The idea is to have a tool where web designers and developers can work together and get rid of handoffs.
> If anyone could check it out and give me your comments and feedback I would really appreciate it.
