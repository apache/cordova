__@norman137__ says 
> you can't XHR on the file:// protocol on cordova-android@10 since it uses WebAssetLoader now (e.g. you have a <https://localhost>) path.

> Alternatively to get the old behaviour, you can use `&lt;preference name="AndroidInsecureFileModeEnabled" value="true" /&gt;` config

__@nanduvad__ says 
> Hi Norman. Merci!

__@norman137__ says

__@mathewp.94__ says 
> To expand on the applink issue, it looks like if I install my app from the app store, the links aren't auto-verifying but if I create a new build they do.
> 
> Perhaps the old build doesn't support Android 12 for some reason, but could also be verifying the links because it's a dev build. It could also be the case that an app installed from the app store takes longer to verify.

__@mathewp.94__ says 
> A new release build (installed from internal beta) suffers from the same issue, app links not verifying.

> Hi. Previous thing I redesigned and implemented with exec. It seems more convenient.

> Now I have some troubles with startup of installed application.
> Do you have prepared some solution for logging or do you expect you will address it?
> The only solid solution I could imagine is writing it directly into main process (with merges) as having it in plugin would not attach to console soon enough.
> 
> Do you have some suggestions here?
> Especialy in relation to other platforms(we concern about iOS). How it is properly solved in a "cordova" way?

__@erisu__ says 
> @miroslav.vojtus Are you talking about the way/ability to debug the application/main process to try and figure out why it is failing before the WebView part?
