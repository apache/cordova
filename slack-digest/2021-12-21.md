__@gh__ says 
> There is an Xcode issue. Make sure you're using Xcode 13.2.1, especially if you are uploading to the iTunes Store. From the <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-13_2_1-release-notes|Xcode 13.2.1 release notes>: "Xcode contains a copy of the log4j library that has the CVE-2021-44228 security vulnerability. Xcode automatically downloads an updated version of this library and installs it into `~/Library/Caches/com.apple.amp.itmstransporter`. When submitting apps to the App Store, Xcode uses the updated version of the library. (86390060)"
