> Bit of a funny question but I know we need to fully parse the plugins before device ready, would defer assist in any plug-in scripts to after device ready, or they would need to be done prior? We're looking at the Google maps plugin (40 script files) and the transistor soft background Geo plug-in as major causes of app init delay and they both have quite a few scripts that we thought we could possibly defer to expedite. Tnx.
