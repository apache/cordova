> <https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.auth.Auth>
> 
> Doesn't sound like firebase supports cordova environments. Because on iOS, your web app runs either from the `file://` protocol, or a scheme of your choosing. Schemes however cannot use existing schemes such as `http` or `https`. So this cannot satisfy their protocol environment.
> 
> On android, the webapp is always served from the `file://` protocol. So android will not satisfy the protocol environment either.
> 
> For android, there is the ionic webview that does allow you to serve the webapp over `http` or `https`, but Google engineers have warned ionic about using that approach so it is a solution that may not work in the future.
