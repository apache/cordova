__@lukas__ says 
> Hi all. I am using the `&lt;resource-file`  tag in my config.xml to copy a file to the iOS project (a storekit configuration for testing). Is there an option to prevent Cordova from overwriting the file if it already exists?

__@mathewp.94__ says 
> I don't think I ever updated this thread but I have talked to AppCenter and they told me:
> - Codepush functionality will technically still work if you're feeling intrepid but, you will need to support the plugin yourself (as the React Native version will continue to work, which maybe uses the same APIs?)
> - App Center Analytics and Crash Analytics will stop working for Cordova
> - Distributing APKs and IPAs through App Center will still work as they are just standard file formats and not related to Cordova
