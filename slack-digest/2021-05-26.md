__@norman137__ says 
> Yes... a cordova plugin can call to a callback context. By default, a callback context is destroyed once it's used, but it's possible to mark as a callback to be kept so that it can be reused.

> Hello everyone. New to cordova. Just got some success in getting the project running, preparing to check in a branch for my collaborator, but I'm not clear how to regenerate the build artifacts. If I remove the platform and plugins directories (as though I am going to place these in .gitignore), doing a "cordova prepare" is failing as it is trying to access files in those directories. What is the proper usage here?
