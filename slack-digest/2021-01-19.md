__@noah.cooper__ says

> ```&lt;preference name="MY_VAR" default="" /&gt;```
> no such luck, though. that causes an error to be thrown if no value is provided by the developer when using the plugin:

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 19:17:13 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> @noah.cooper You can use your plugin to inject a blank preference into the platform's config.xml. If it's also provided at the app-level config.xml, that will override the one from the plugin.
> ex. <https://github.com/AyogoHealth/cordova-plugin-update-notifier/blob/main/plugin.xml#L37>

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 19:19:24 GMT

__@noah.cooper__ says 
> @dpogue so you’re saying if i just use the `value` attribute instead of `default`, it’ll work?
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 19:19:43 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> Not quite, you have to put it inside the `config-file` block
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 19:38:28 GMT

__@noah.cooper__ says 
> @dpogue that doesn’t seem to help, actually. in the example you linked, that’s not a preference specific to `cordova-plugin-update-notifier` like in this case.

> if I do:

> ```&lt;preference name="MY_VAR" /&gt;
> &lt;config-file parent="/*" target="config.xml"&gt;
>   &lt;preference name="MY_VAR" value="" /&gt;
> &lt;/config-file&gt;```

__@dpogue__ says 
> I hate how the `preference` tag has multiple meanings in different contexts, because it _always_ confuses everyone 😑
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 19:40:33 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> In plugin.xml (within the plugin element), `preference` defines a variable that must be passed in on the command-line at install time (or via package.json on restore)
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 19:40:59 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> This is _entirely different_ than the `preference` key/value pairs defined in config.xml
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 19:41:20 GMT

__@chadwick.blackford__ says

> you are not alone 😃

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 19:43:31 GMT

__@noah.cooper__ says 
> @dpogue i’m talking about the former. to your point, it must be passed in on the command line at install time, but i’m trying to figure out a way to allow an empty string to be used at install time
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 19:45:17 GMT

__@noah.cooper__ says 
> reason being i’m trying to set something in `*-Info.plist` either to a value specified at install time, or an empty string
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 19:45:39 GMT

__@noah.cooper__ says 
> i’m thinking this might not be possible and i might have to do this with a hook
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 19:46:52 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> Yeah, if `default=""` is getting detected as not having a default, then I don't think it's supported 😞
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 19:48:17 GMT

__@noah.cooper__ says 
> yeah i think <https://github.com/apache/cordova-common/blob/master/src/PluginInfo/PluginInfo.js#L68> stops this from working. shoot

__@mario.kurzweil__ says 
> Is the plugin <https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-splashscreen/> obsolete with cordova-ios 6.1.1? Are there any troubles if it’s still installed?

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 13:29:59 GMT

__@chadwick.blackford__ says 
> @mario.kurzweil yes

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 13:30:33 GMT

__@chadwick.blackford__ says

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 13:32:41 GMT

__@mario.kurzweil__ says 
> @chadwick.blackford the support of the splashscreen plugin is in my opinion really good. Thx for the quick response 🙂
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 13:33:09 GMT

__@chadwick.blackford__ says 
> @mario.kurzweil cordova support splascreen too…
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 13:33:50 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> it's obsolete because the splashscreen code has moved to the core cordova-ios platform. If you only develop for iOS, you can remove the plugin altogether. Otherwise I suggest updating to the latest release of the splashscreen. Running an older version may cause conflicts.

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 13:36:39 GMT

__@jcesarmobile__ says 
> Latest version should automatically skip iOS install if using latest cordova-ios 
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 14:00:12 GMT

__@mario.kurzweil__ says 
> I know it’s the wrong channel, but was the splashscreen code also moved to cordova-android platform?

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 14:01:30 GMT

__@jose2013__ says 
> *Issue/Workaround info:*
> 
> I needed to upgrade to the *BigSur and Xcode 12.3* but after this I cannot run an App in the simulator never more, it fails with `Building for iOS Simulator, but the embedded framework 'FlyBuySDK.framework' was built for iOS + iOS Simulator.`.
> It seems to be related to Xcode enforcing the use of XCFramework.
> 
> *Workaround:* Under Build Settings - Navigate to Validate Workspace - Change it to YES.

> Have anyone seen the error above?

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 20:15:47 GMT

__@jose2013__ says 
> Note: I can now build as before after using the workaround 😛

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 20:16:04 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> yeah... I've run into that with some non-Cordova projects
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 20:16:17 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> You can actually change Validate Workspace back to NO and it will still work
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 20:16:39 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> You just need to change it once so that it actually gets declared in the Xcode project file
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 20:16:47 GMT

__@jose2013__ says 
> Oh, good that you mentioned.
> This is coming from a plugin that I developing, the plugin uses an 3rd party SDK.

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 20:17:08 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> Yep, basically anything distributed as a `.framework` file is going to run into this

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 20:17:21 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> Apple wants everyone to move to `.xcframework`

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 20:18:30 GMT

__@jose2013__ says 
> &gt; You just need to change it once so that it actually gets declared in the Xcode project file
> Should we have it explicit set in the cordova-ios to prevent it happening to other users?
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 20:18:53 GMT

__@jose2013__ says 
> I meant, isn’t the case for a fix?
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 20:19:25 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> Yeah, that would probably be a good idea, can you open an issue on cordova-ios for it?
> 

Mon, 18 Jan 2021 20:20:09 GMT

__@jose2013__ says 
> Yep, thank you! I’m looking forward to create this fix

> hello again, I have strange issue. I was redoing my OS and at the end I have different name for my account in OS.
> I have a app which was previously released, now having a new version.
> When I am trying to release again the gradle is giving me the  Keystore file does not exist error because it referencing the old location of the keystore file.
> I have the same behavior if I try JSON or even if I use command line. (searching the files with old path/name gives me zillion results)
