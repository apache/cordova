__@drouard.noelie__ says 
> hello! Happy new year to all of you ðŸ™‚
> does anyone use j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase ?  I am reading the doc and am a little confused as it is not my native language. What do we need to do if the user cancels the purchase? I have the "store.when().cancelled(product), but I don't know what to do afterwards. A refresh?

__@norman137__ says 
> I don't use that plugin (or any in-app purchase plugins for that matter) but that really depends on your app. Cancel event notifies you that the user did not proceed to make an actual purchase of the product. It's up to you to ensure your app responds appropriately. e.g. acknowledging/providing user feedback that the purchase was cancelled.

> I think the plugin is well maintained but the support is extremely lacking, so if you have an issue with the documentation or missing/wrong events you are on your own. I have a problem with expired subscriptions I'm unable to solve.
