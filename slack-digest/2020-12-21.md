> Hi everybody, do someone use cordova-plugin-googlemaps? I have couple of question which I cant figure out. (because my poor JavaScrit skills)
> 1. there is
> `// open the last marker title.`
> `markers[markers.length - 1].showInfoWindow();`
> what can be the code for showing all of them?
> 2. Is there a  way how to load Google Map without properties on it (businesses, shops..)?
> 3. what is proper way of selecting options for particular object? should I make options variable or I can add them directly to demo code?
> Thanks
