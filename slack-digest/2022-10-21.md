__@ulimetic__ says 
> What's the point hiring people and have them develop if the PR are stuck for 3 years. Here's the real problem! Maybe there shouldn't be a jump from cordova-ios from 6.2.0 to 7 and wait 3 years. Smaller releases, more often, less PRs at a time. The issue with this project is 100% management. Lots of people spend hours but the bottleneck happens at merging stuff, so it means that the "maintainers" are holding this project back

__@xavier.serra__ says 
> What I am trying to say is that being Apache Cordova such a widely used technology there should be more economic collaboration from companies that use it. Volunteering is great but people have other obligations in life.

__@erisu__ says

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 09:56:07 GMT

__@erisu__ says

> I dont remember, but I think if you change the targetSDK to 33 it might check for 33 then..

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 10:03:42 GMT

__@info460__ says 
> Working now ... what a magic , thank you for help
> P.S. what is recommended gradle version? I can see that in modules it's downloading another version 7.2.1

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 10:04:58 GMT

__@erisu__ says 
> If you are talking about system Gradle version, the latest version is sufficient. Cordova will checkout the version it needs unless your changing the default.
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 10:05:46 GMT

__@erisu__ says 
> If you were to say change the targetSDK for the project to 33, then there is a chance you need a newer version of Gradle defined in the project config.xml

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 10:05:48 GMT

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 16:13:22 GMT

__@info460__ says 
> Please anyone have a link where is simply explained the new splash screen system? I can't make it working from Google dev page and Cordova Apache page is describing for version11 still old &lt;splash system
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 16:36:40 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> <https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/11.x/core/features/splashscreen/index.html#android-specific-information> is probably the place to start.
> 
> I'll note that the docs uses `xml` indicating vectors but they appear to be only supported in API 25 if I recall correectly. You can pass in rastered image format, like png instead.
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 16:37:59 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> The simpliest configuration will likely involve `AndroidWindowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon` preference (which doesn't necessary have to be an animated icon) and `AndroidWindowSplashScreenBackground` to control the background color of the splashscreen.
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 16:40:28 GMT

__@erisu__ says 
> &gt; Android 5.0 (API level 21) was the first version to officially support vector drawables with `VectorDrawable` 
> It is the Animated Vector Drawables (AVD) that was introduced in API 25.
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 16:41:02 GMT

__@erisu__ says 
> I believe XML vector drawables can still be used and support down to the minimum SDK version that Cordova-Android 11 targets by default.
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 16:46:45 GMT

__@erisu__ says 
> Also, I think in Google docs, might have said something like following the Adaptive Iconâ€™s requirements, but I believe it is referencing in terms of image sizing.
> 
> You might be able to provide an XML with `adaptive-icon` tags, but Adaptive Icons was introduced in API level 26. So if you need to support further back that is out of the question.
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 16:47:41 GMT

__@erisu__ says 
> But as Norman pointed out, you can still provide PNGs, but still needs to follow the image size requirements that Google documented.

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:00:10 GMT

__@info460__ says 
> What a mess. ( I mean whole story about new icons and splash). They just produced a need for a brand new industry of icons just because some effects....
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:02:04 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Yah, I, (well mostly someone else) had to craft new images for our apps for the splashscreen.
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:03:18 GMT

__@info460__ says 
> I mean I am reading about that for 2 hours already and still no idea where to even start (sorry for rant just frustrated...)
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:07:27 GMT

__@info460__ says 
> Probably I will remove splash screen completely and use logo (if I need )as part of the app itself
> 
> Thank you all

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:08:22 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> This has been minimally tested (I'm still working on a cordova-android@11 update in my apps) but this is the splashscreen icon image we are currently using. It's at a high dpi for for larger devices, but appears to scale down properly on lower dpi devices. You could use it as a reference in how to construct your image.
> 
> E.g. use the same canvas size, but don't use space out of the bounds of the icon, because google masks the image and takes a circle out of the image, so parts of it will be clipped. The icon is about the largest size it can be without it being clipped.
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:08:47 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> You can probably use more space on the Y axis
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:08:59 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> since my icon is more width dominant.

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:09:58 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> it also has a tranparent background but slack doesn't seem to make that distinction and uses a dark gray background (at least in dark theme)
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:15:36 GMT

__@info460__ says 
> Can you please send me also your splashcreen.xml as I think this is the most complicated part for me
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:15:50 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> i dont use a splashscreen.xml

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:18:55 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> ```&lt;preference name="AndroidWindowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon" value="res/android/splash/xxxhdpi.png" /&gt;
>         &lt;preference name="AndroidWindowSplashScreenBackground" value="#6dADDF" /&gt;```
> This is what I use instead, where `res/android/splash/xxxhdpi.png` is the path to my png file
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 19:22:45 GMT

__@info460__ says 
> Thank you, I think this clears the splash screen quite a lot for me. ( I was in impression that I have to use splash screen XML file for some reason).
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 20:36:47 GMT

__@info460__ says 
> Just comments about the splash screen on my Android 8.1 device
> 1. If I remove the SS plugin and all references of it from config.xml it still show default Cordova splash
> 2. By adding SplashScreenDelay with value 0 still show default Cordova SS
> 3. Adding ShowSplashScreen with value false will still show the SS
> 4. SplashShowOnlyFirstTime true also no effect
> 

Thu, 20 Oct 2022 20:51:45 GMT

__@jcesarmobile__ says 
> Splash screen is now part of cordova-android, you have to uninstall the plugin. And it always shows now even if you set the time to 0 because thatâ€™s the behavior google implemented for android 12 and for older versions cordova used the support library they provided
