__@harel.mazor__ says 
> I've just removed ionic-webview plugin from my codebase due to an issue in iOS of too many events sent when long pressing (and also it's not well maintained and I need to reduce the dependency of these kind of project).
> The side effect of that is that I lost all the local storage data.
> Is there a way to configure something in cordova to bring it back? The host name and protocol or something? Has anyone did it and can give some pointers?

> web storage access is based on the origin. It's not lost, it's just that it creates a new database files for every new origin.

> ionic by default for ios uses `<ionic://localhost>` if I recall correctly, cordova uses `<app://localhost>`. You should be able to set the `scheme` preference to `ionic` for ios so that your origin remains the same, and thus continue to use the same web storage that exists on the device.
