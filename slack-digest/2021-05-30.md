> Hey ! Anybody faced these ? I am just stuck with these:
> 1. In the device with iOS 14.6, if I inspect  my app using safari, app crashes. It happens due to some memory issue is what I read, <https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/679015>
> 2. Post WKWebView Migration, newer webview treats every integer number as a real number in iOS devices. This becomes problematic on saving and fetching data to/from SQLite, queries fail many times due to this. [ cos 1 != 1.0 ]
> Any solution/suggestions ?
