> I upgraded to cordova-ios version 6.2.0. I'm having a problem.

__@norman137__ says 
> UIWebView did allow it by default, WKWebView disallows it by default. Cordova simply uses the default behaviour.
> 
> I think the behaviour on WKWebView can be overridded via <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/1414973-loadfileurl?language=objc> but Cordova doesn't offer any preference to set this, so cordova-ios will have to be forked.

> I tried <https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-flashlight|https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-flashlight> and it works fine, but it does not work well on Android cell phones, especially when they are old, I activate it but the lamp does not light.

Fri, 27 Aug 2021 22:26:40 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> First thing is to determine if there is an error being printed in the JS console. Not all phones support the flash lamp.
> 
> I think the app also requires to have the camera permission since the lamp is part of the camera API.

__@erisu__ says 
> The paramedic appium tests are failing but we could disable them for now IMO. All of our plugins and the plugin repo you showed do not have nor run Appium tests.
> Turning it off might be the quickest solution to pass the last issue and we can return to it later.
> But with it off, paramedic now finished successfully.

__@zach657__ says 
> Also regarding the CI and other work you mentioned. I don’t see the branches or forks. I’m open to collaborating on that if I can.
> 
> As I mentioned before I’ve done something, regarding the GitHub Actions. However I noticed the the TravisCI is currently doing much more than what I’ve been doing.

__@erisu__ says 
> Cool 👍 I think we will be able to merge this in.
> 
> In the past, I had added the `scheme` and `hostname` preference options to the `cordova-plugin-test-framework`, to resolve the iOS issues.
> 
> But while looking into Android, with a fresh view, I started to think the `paramedic-plugin`  was the better choice. This plugin appears to be added for all platforms and is responsible for the test results reporting. I think it might be the plugin that should manage the scheme &amp; clearText settings. And the bonuse is that this plugin is in the same repo. Keeps all these changes together.
> 
> After this merge, I believe I can also revert my iOS scheme changes from `cordova-plugin-test-framework` as well.

Sat, 28 Aug 2021 03:37:59 GMT

__@erisu__ says 
> I would like to get the Appium tests to work again, but I can look into this issue on a seperate PR.
> 
> Cordova's core plugins do not have any Appium tests for Android, and this is why I turned it off for now.
> 
> Only paramedic had some tests to confirm it working. Just for a reference, if you wanted to see the failing Appium tests, you can remove this flag `"skipAppiumTests": true` from this file `conf/pr/local/android-11.config.json`

Sat, 28 Aug 2021 04:19:05 GMT

__@zach657__ says 
> Also, really excited about Codespaces, so I'll try to open PRs for those too so that development is easy and at least paramedic can be run for browser and android

Sat, 28 Aug 2021 04:46:19 GMT

__@erisu__ says 
> Yeah, it will be on the plugins for sure.  🙂
> 
> There is just one more thing needed before it can happen. The last thing we need to do for the paramedic repo is adding the test matrix. Once it is added to the paramedic CI configs, then we should just cut and paste them to the plugins. The paramedic CI configs should be for the most part the template of the plugins CI.
> 
> This is what Apache Cordova needs to cover in the test matrix:
> 
> Android: 5.1, 6, 7, 7.1, 8, 8.1, 9, 10, 11, (12)
> iOS: 12.5.4, 13.7, 14.7.1
> 
> All in all, I am excited to finally see us completing the migration to GH Actions. We have been working on this task for quite some time and I believe these were the remaining repos. It was also the most challenging.
> 
> The plugins should be getting the changes real soon.

Sat, 28 Aug 2021 05:59:11 GMT

__@erisu__ says 
> In your plugin’s action run, I see you also copied our action workflow.
> 
> Just a heads up, for the Android workflow, I updated the the macos setting back to `masos-latest`. I also removed the `emulator-build` pinning. I set these before and thought the issues were related to the GH link I posted in the workflow config file. But your older configs used the latest and worked. I think it was the clearText that resolved the original issue I saw.

__@erisu__ says 
> Also, I might remove the caching step.
> 
> I like the idea of caching to speed up the CI, but for Apache Cordova this might not be possible. For your own plugin, if you are only testing against one API level, then it should be OK to keep. You might want to improve the caching key though.
> 
> Why I think we cant support caching on Apache is because we need to support a large test matrix. This will surpass the allowed caching limit.
> 
> &gt; A repository can have up to 5GB of caches. Once the 5GB limit is reached, older caches will be evicted based on when the cache was last accessed. Caches that are not accessed within the last week will also be evicted.
> Here is an example avd file size I have locally. All newly created and never launched.:
> ```2.5G    Pixel_2_API_22.avd
> 2.5G    Pixel_2_API_23.avd
> 1.0G    Pixel_3_API_26.avd
> 523M    Pixel_4_API_29.avd
> 524M    Pixel_4_API_30.avd
> 525M    Pixel_4_API_31.avd```
> This alone totals up to around 7.5GB, this also covers 5 of the 10 versions I listed earlier.
> 
> Most likely on each run it wont find the cache because it was evicted. Also we only talking about Android here.
