__@osaintilien55__ says 
> I'm installing Android studio on a new machine and I get this warning "_*SDK Location should not contain whitespaces*_", if I change the path to some other place(I think this is my only option, not able to rename the users folder) everything should still work just fine right?

__@norman137__ says 
> The initial run will always be the longest but generally speaking you don't change native code very often when developing a cordova app, so as long as you have the gradle daemon enabled (which is the default setting), it will cache the compiled results and subsequent runs should be fairly quick.

__@osaintilien55__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> You probably don't want to use the ip `127.0.0.1`, that is localhost, or the device itself... which probably isn't running the webserver

Fri, 30 Oct 2020 02:48:00 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Assuming you're running the server on your PC, you'd want to find the private ip of your PC, make sure the server is listening on that private ip, then point the device to connect to that private ip.

Fri, 30 Oct 2020 02:48:30 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> The device also needs to be connected to the same network as the PC for that to work.

__@osaintilien55__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> I have a custom script for when I build my apps I define the environment, and based on the environment the "server target' changes, to private ip for development, or the production server if building for release, etc.

__@osaintilien55__ says

> hello 🙂 i have the latest versions of cordova and the oneSignal plugin, but when I try to set up the plugin, I have a problem. I need to use cocoapods, it's installed, but there is no Pods folder and i need it to finalize the set up (step 3.16 of this link) <https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/ionic-sdk-setup> . has someone had the same problem?

__@ben201__ says 
> So I am having issues with images taken from Cordova Camera being under a tmp url when I store them in the DB and return later on with them now cleaned up. Previously we used CDVFILE to get an actual persistent file uri however I cannot run those through the new window.WkWebView.convertFilePath(image). How are other people dealing with this? I am getting myself abit lost I think. #
