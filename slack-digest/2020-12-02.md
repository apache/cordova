__@mpriddy__ says

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 19:46:04 GMT

__@norman137__ says

__@mpriddy__ says

> 

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:29:40 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> By default cordova-ios still uses the `file://` protocol, mainly because by moving away from that protocol to a scheme, your origin changes, which means you lose access to your web storage containers, such as local storage, indexeddb, cookies, etc.

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:30:03 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:30:14 GMT

__@mpriddy__ says

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:30:35 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> If maintaining those local storage containers is important and you don't wanna deal with migrating data

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:31:47 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Then you have to use a plugin... <https://github.com/oracle/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-file-xhr>

> If you can afford to deal with data migration or the data stored in web storage containers is easily reconstructable... the better approach would be to use schemes... link incoming

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:33:05 GMT

__@mpriddy__ says

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:34:25 GMT

__@mpriddy__ says 
> I’m having difficulty identifying where the dividing line is between these two solutions.

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:36:02 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> if you don't care about maintaining data in local storage/cookies/indexedb, etc... ie the data can be easily replaced, then use schemes. Schemes solves many issues surrounding cors and other web restrictions that occur when using the `file://` protocol.

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:36:35 GMT

__@mpriddy__ says 
> I am pretty sure that rebuilding localstorage is going to be OK.

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:37:10 GMT

__@mpriddy__ says 
> So I’m leaning toward the schemes solution. Does that involve only adding those two preferences to the config.xml - or is there more to it?

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:37:20 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Nope that should be it.

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:37:41 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Your app will appear to be hosted from `<app://localhost>` instead of `file://`
> 

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:38:10 GMT

__@mpriddy__ says 
> Do those options need to be wrapped in `&lt;platform name="ios"&gt;` or can they just be “bare” in the config?
> 

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:38:15 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> You can change the scheme to your preference, but you cannot use well known schemes such as `http` or `https`... and once you pick one you'd want to stick with it

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 23:01:25 GMT

__@mpriddy__ says

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 23:02:11 GMT

__@mpriddy__ says 
> But I’m getting CORS errors for remote resources, too:

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 23:02:48 GMT

__@mpriddy__ says

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 23:19:35 GMT

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 23:19:52 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 23:20:59 GMT

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 23:21:05 GMT

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 23:22:36 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 23:22:57 GMT

__@mpriddy__ says

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 23:23:47 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> It doesn't have to be static either, my server does this dynamically by looking at the request `Origin` header and if it's acceptable, then I set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`on the response to the value of the request `Origin` header.

Tue, 01 Dec 2020 23:24:44 GMT

__@norman137__ says

I have a plugin using the `podspec` element and `use-frameworks` attribute, however the generated Podfile does not have the `use_frameworks!` directive after prepare and build has been run.
