> Hi guys, I have a question for the procedure to fix this issue it bothers me in the few days. It was the issue targeting the Android 31 SDK or higher in my ionic-cordova app since it is now required in the Play Store (Photo 1.1 (below in the Thread) an error after I uploaded a release build with targetSDK 30).

And now I think they release the full version of AndroidSDK 31.

> Since the issue was already fixed in a pr in the repo (<https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/pull/1372> ) . And still I’m still running an issue (below – auto setting up AndroidManifest.xml file to “android:exported=’false’”) and also my config.xml file, ionic info &amp; AndroidManifest.xml. Thank you in advance for a reply.
