__@norman137__ says 
> Android Studio is tightly coupled to the AGP (Android Gradle Plugin) and cordova-android builds are also tightly to the AGP so if you've updated Android Studio, but are using an older cordova-android version, you may run into incompatibilities with Android Studio.
> 
> It should compile fine when running gradle directly (via cordova command line) but the Android Studio IDE will fail to sync with gradle.
