__@daviesd__ says 
> Did anything change from cordova-ios 6.1.1 -&gt; 6.2.0 that would be affecting my bundle version?  When I submit with transporter, my previous build with cordova-ios@6.1.1 had it set properly.  Now it's getting set to (4) instead of (3.1.2.2).

__@daviesd__ says

__@dpogue__ says

Wed, 10 Nov 2021 19:19:57 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> ya. we never use xcode ui or archive to build our binary.  it's all command line and the file ends up in a directory that I push with Transporter.  So this is gonna break that non-human interaction flow.

__@daviesd__ says

Wed, 10 Nov 2021 19:48:51 GMT

__@daviesd__ says

Wed, 10 Nov 2021 19:53:11 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> yep, if I put 5, it chooses 5.  ok. so I guess the right thing to do is rework my build to just use the buildnum (1,2,3,4,5) as the bundleversion

Thu, 11 Nov 2021 04:30:36 GMT

__@daviesd__ says 
> @lz1ncs I'm going back and looking at making this work with manageAppVersionAndBuildNumber.  I see that by default the ExportOptions.plist file that is under platforms/ios/build/device has
