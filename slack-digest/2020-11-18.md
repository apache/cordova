__@khatridevk__ says 
> Looks like this plugin has dependency over webview engine plugin. Also, there are some forks available without this dependencies, I will have a check. But, is it recommended. Would there be any risk in doing such copy !!

__@osaintilien55__ says 
> Ok so after having changed all my manipulations to use "transforms", it's much smoother(lessy laggy) but I find that at times the app becomes unresponsive at random. I get delays after pressing buttons but this behavior is not consistent. Sometimes delay, other times no delay. There are no errors in the remote browser. When I test on my computer browser there are no delays. Not sure if this is a device limitation. I hear that the Crosswalk plugin makes things better however would like to be sure that this is not happening because of the way I am doing things. What should I check?

> If you're experiencing performance issues, you're best bet is to use the performance audit tools available in the web inspector. You can get a breakdown of how long functions take to run and how much time is spent in those functions.

> You basically prepare the state of the app to just before you see slow downs, then hit the record button, trigger the action, then stop recording.
