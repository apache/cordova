__@duaneqhodges__ says 
> My issue is I keep getting rejected by the Apple store for having UIWeb in my plugins. So I've upgraded all of my plugins but my issue is Google Plus won't install with cordova-ios 6.x. I can only get Google Plus installed with cordova-ios 5.1.1. The conflict is that cordova inapp browser won't install on 5.1.1, it needs 6.x or greater. I'm not sure how to resolve this issue with two different cordova plugins requiring different cordova-ios versions.

> or maybe you can just fork the plugin that restricts cordova-ios@6 and remove that restriction and pray it works. There shouldn't really be any reason why it wouldn't work on cordova-ios@6, unless if it uses UIWebView, in which case your app will still get rejected.

__@mattwenner1__ says 
> Just ran into an interesting situation that I believe is happening after updating `webpack` and was wondering if anyone ran into something similar before?  The issue is only occurring on android, but not ios when building my production bundles for my React: `webpack --mode=production --progress.`
>  The error I get is `Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`, the problem is just references to line 2, which is basically the whole bundle when I inspect with `<chrome://inspect/#devices>`
> 
> However if I run in development mode: `webpack --mode=development --progress --watch` everything works fine on android
> 
> So it seems that there is some optimization issue occurring only on android?

__@mattwenner1__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> I guess `devtool` isn't working for you since it can't parse the file... are you using any minification plugins like UglifyJS (including web pack's built in stuff?) Maybe on your prod built disable those and see if the issue persists, and if so hopefully it exists on a non-minified build so that it's easier to pinpoint what exactly is causing the syntax error.

__@tvanzanten__ says 
> Has anyone been able to successfully change the status bar color on iOS with the `cordova-plugin-statusbar`? I'm using `cordova-ios` 6.2.0, `cordova-plugin-statusbar` 2.4.3, an iPhone 11 running iOS 14.4.2, and a vanilla Cordova application.
> 
> As you can see in the screenshot, the status bar for my application is a light grey (I think this is because the content at the top of my app is white), and the text in my status bar is white, making it practically illegible.
> 
> I've tried setting this in my app's config.xml:
> 
> ```&lt;preference name="StatusBarBackgroundColor" value="#000000" /&gt;```
> And adding the following inside a function that gets called when the `deviceready` event triggers:
> 
> ```StatusBar.styleLightContent();
> StatusBar.backgroundColorByHexString('#0854a0');```
> But neither of those solutions worked. Any help would be much appreciated!
