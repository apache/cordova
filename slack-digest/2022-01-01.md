__@john518__ says 
> Hello ðŸ‘‹ , any idea why gradle always appears to be out of date after running `cordova build`?

__@norman137__ says 
> &gt; Configuration 'compile' in project ':app' is deprecated. Use 'implementation' instead.
> You have a plugin that is including a gradle resource which is using the `compile` api in gradle which is deprecated. I believe all of Apache maintained plugins have already switched to `implementation`, but if not, a bug ticket can be created. You'd have to track down what is adding that part of the gradle code though. This shouldn't be related to the build failure.
> 
> &gt; Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 7.0
> This is generally caused by an upstream dependency of Cordova, the Android Gradle Plugin. This message is safe to ignore. Cordova by default uses gradle wrappers, so regardless of the system gradle version you have installed, it will always install a gradle wrapper at a version it knows is compatible with AGP and other dependencies. Again this, shouldn't be related to the build failure in your screenshot.

__@john518__ says 
> Hi Norman, thank you for the infoâ€¦ In that case, is the same true for the following errors? The individual plugin(s) needs to be updated?

__@norman137__ says 
> yah that's pretty old. Looks like you're looking at the project inside android studio. Did you happen to accept any "upgrade" prompts for gradle and such? If so, that will very likely break the project.

__@norman137__ says 
> Cordova-android 7.x I think only works with gradle 3 or 4... so you shouldn't be seeing any messages related to gradle 7

__@john518__ says 
> I did at one point, but then nuked the project and started again and skipped update but still get an issueâ€¦ trouble is, if I go with the latest version of `cordova-android` I get errors like this

__@john518__ says 
> Iâ€™ve been using cordova for a few years now and Android is always a pain to build compared to XCodeâ€¦ Is that the same for you?

__@norman137__ says 
> Not really ðŸ˜… but I am more familiar with Android stuff than I am with any apple product. ADB is garbage though.
> 
> For that error that happens on cordova-android@10, that's because cordova-android@10 enforces androidX support libraries, which are incompatible with the older, now legacy, support libraries, (eg. anything `android.support.` package).
> 
> I think most Apache-maintained plugins again have been updated to use the androidX equivalent libraries but for other third-party plugins that are either slow or unwilling to maintain their plugins for whatever reason, the `cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter`[1] usually does a good job of fixing plugins still using the old support libraries.

__@norman137__ says 
> The way Google handled AndroidX stuff is horrible. cordova-android@9 tried to find a way to support both, but it became quite evident it was impossible to support both legacy and androidx at the same time, they simply won't compile together.

__@john518__ says 
> Damn. I had no idea, been stuck an an old version for a while nowâ€¦ Does make you worry about the future of cordova. Do you think itâ€™s days are numbered?

__@john518__ says 
> FYI: I personally love it, tend to write all my UI stuff in pure JS and use cordova to wrap it

__@norman137__ says 
> &gt; Does make you worry about the future of cordova. Do you think itâ€™s days are numbered?
> We do have limited volunteers compared so we have been downsizing our maintenance load. e.g. deprecating the osx/windows platforms (in favor of the newer electron platform). Personally I'd also like to deprecate the browser platform as well (I don't think the platform makes any sense as unlike inside the native platforms we can't really polyfill much native behaviour in the browser).

__@john518__ says 
> Totally agree about dropping support for the browser, we only use cordova for access to the device. Weâ€™re in the same boat in terms of a rewrite, it would take a LOT of effort and Iâ€™m not convinced weâ€™d gain anything, the end user would not see the benefit. Iâ€™ve always hoped PWAs would gradually get more access to the hardware, and the need for cordova plugins would fade away

__@john518__ says 
> My issue is now resolved. I upgraded `cordova-android` to the latest version and added `cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter` as you suggested and it now builds ðŸš€ Thank you for your help!!
