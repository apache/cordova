__@norman137__ says 
> The js version of google maps is intended to be ran from a website (hosted by a server with a domain) which doesn't fit what cordova is (since the "webapp" on cordova is domain-less). If you want to display google maps, you're better off using a plugin that provides you an interface to the native mobile sdk for google maps.

__@erisu__ says

Wed, 09 Dec 2020 03:05:10 GMT
