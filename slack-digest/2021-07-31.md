__@norman137__ says 
> a plugin is adding `queries` tag in the `manifest` which is not a valid tag according to your version of AAPT. Looking at <https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/queries-element>, `queries` was added in version 30, which means you should be using cordova-android@10 (which has API 30 support) with build-tools 30.0.3 or later (but not version 31.x)

__@mohanraj.l__ says 
> Hi Team, I try to use cordova-android@10.0.0. I have noticed that VERSION file missing in node_modules unlike previous versions. Is this expected? I wanted to figure out the version of cordova-android from pre install hook. Is there any other ways of detecting the cordova-android version?
