> - The splashscreen plugin is in the process of being dismantled and the code is being migrated to the core platform. This has been done in `cordova-ios@6` so if you're using `cordova-ios@6` there are probably conflicts happening. The latest version the apache's version of splashscreen has all iOS code removed.

__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hi folks, I'm curious to know other people's experiences with plugins slowing down your app's initialization.
> The screenshot below shows the plugins taking up 4s from when they're injected to when they finish loading. This doesn't include the other scripts and assets that my app uses, so this is really expensive. Has anyone come up with a way to optimize the plugins loading? My case looks like death by a thousand cuts because I use a lot of plugins and in total they inject more than 130 scripts into the `&lt;head&gt;` tag during app init. It seems as though each script does just a little bit of work, but together they take up a large chunk of time. Any ideas/suggestions apart from just using fewer plugins? I'm considering forking the plugins and modifying them to load each function using dynamic `import()` when I actually invoke the function. Does anyone know or sense any shortcomings/concerns with such a strategy? I've also noticed that the initial `load` event after parsing the `cordova.js` file doesn't fire until around 3s into app init, so this 4s chunk of time only begins 3s into app init, giving me at least 7s of delay before `deviceready` fires, so most of my app's main logic can't run during this period. Really quite expensive. Open to any ideas, thanks in advance. These are the plugins I use:
