> Hello, everyone!
> 
> Can someone help me with google recaptcha on cordova hybrid project? To be precise it`s reCaptcha v3 we are using.
> The recaptcha script is not being attached to page. At first that was only on iOS, but, i swear to god, it was functioning on Android, so i uploaded new version to store.
> But it`s been 4 days and now script is not in the DOM on Android as well.
> I`ve been searching and trying a lot in internet, none solution works.
> 
> Here is my final config.xml i`ve been trying
> 
> ```COMMON
>  &lt;access origin="https://*.google.com/*"/&gt;
>  &lt;allow-navigation href="*://localhost"/&gt;
>  &lt;allow-navigation href="<https://www.google.com/recaptcha/*>" /&gt;
>     
> platform=ios
>  &lt;preference name="Hostname" value="myapp.local" /&gt; (cordova-plugin-ionic-webview)
>  &lt;allow-navigation href="<http://myapp.local/*>" /&gt;
>  &lt;allow-navigation href="<https://www.google.com/recaptcha/*>" /&gt;
> 
> platform=android
>    no specific configuration
>         
>  and in my google recaptcha console i have *localhost* and *myapp.local* declared
> 
> Domain Check\Validation in captcha admin console in turned on as well. One of solutions i have seen is to turn it off, dont think its a good idea....```
