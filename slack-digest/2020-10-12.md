> Is there a way to effectively load scripts ? I am struggling with white screen issue on ios 12 and lower versions (scripts keeps on loading), while on ios 13+ it works seamlessly (cordova-ios used is 6.1.1). I suspect this is because of memory leakage. Please let me know if any solution to this. Thanks &amp; Kind Regards , Pratiksha
