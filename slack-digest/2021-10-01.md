__@miroslav.vojtus__ says 
> Hello all. Do you have please a suggestion how to properly implemennt main process to web notifications with the newest cordova-electron plugin system? I learned it is possible to perfrom cordova.exec but I do not know how to do a observer pattern where web observes events from a cordova-electron plugin.
> I guess there is no such a support yet and I have to override `cdv-electron-preload.js`  with some ipc + cordova/channel.

__@costagauci__ says 
> Hi, can anyone recommend an API for reading photos and videos from iPhone and Android devices? I've tried cordova-plugin-photo-library however that does not work with videos and takes a long time to load if there are a lot of files on a device. I've also tried cordova-gallery-api however that returns an SQLITE_ERROR and has not been updated in 7 years.

__@norman137__ says 
> "Access control" checks refers to the CORS protocol. Your server is not responding properly.
> 
> Your server should respond with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.
> 
> The preflight response error is related to your server not correctly responding to the `OPTIONS` request variant of your API. For every API request you do, your server should also respond to the `OPTIONS` method variant of that API. The `OPTIONS` variant should respond with no body (e.g. it should have `Content-Length: 0`, and it should also have Access-Control headers defined. Particarly `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, but you can also declare `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` and `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`.
> 
> `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` should be 1 value, either a domain or a wilcard `*`. In my experience however, older iOS devices didn't respond to wildcard correctly, so you may want to dynamically read the request's `Origin` header and set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` dynamically as a work-around for wildcard.
> 
> `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` is a comma delimited of HTTP methods allowable, etc: `GET, POST, OPTIONS` -- note `OPTIONS` is required to support preflight requests.
> `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is a comma delimited list of acceptable HTTP headers.

> I have a blog post that goes into much more detail: <https://breautek.com/articles/enabling-cors.html>

__@norman137__ says 
> CORS is a browser security concept. It's implementation in the context of native app WebViews imo doesn't make sense, which is why it's confusing. But there is no API to disable it.

__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Okay thanks Norman. My builds are done on a CI system so I'm not able to search that folder easily. I tried setting the `implementation` to `1.3.0` using the `before_build` hook:
> ```buildscript {
>   dependencies {
>     // Add this line
>     implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.0'
>   }
> }```
>  but now I'm getting this error:
> &gt; Could not find method implementation() for arguments [[REDACTED]x.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.0] on object of type org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.dsl.dependencies.DefaultDependencyHandler.
> Any ideas as to what could be causing this? Seems like I didn't format the changes correctly.

__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hey folks,
> 
> I get a `401` error when I try to download images using the file-transfer plugin. My server doesn't return a `401` status at all, so it's not an issue with authentication on my server. I tracked down the code that's generating the `401` status to this <https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file-transfer/blob/ec11d2fd0e87d7d9e0ba94b1989ffb71af1c3c96/src/android/FileTransfer.java#L698|line of code> that sends the `401` status if the url is not in the allow list for the app. The problem is that the url should match because its base is in the allow list. I have set the allow list to allow both full and wildcard matching of the base url, yet this problem continues to happen. These are my `access` tags for the base url:
> ```    &lt;access origin="<https://cloud.dev.textras.com/*>" /&gt;
>     &lt;access origin="https://*.dev.textras.com/*" /&gt;
>     &lt;access origin="https://*.textras.com/*" /&gt;```
> And an example of an image url that's not getting downloaded is `<https://cloud.dev.textras.com/v1/media/round?r=32&amp;q=100&amp;f=images/6151be6d02dbc700142308af/thumbnail.jpeg>`. The image loads correctly in an `img` tag and in the browser.
