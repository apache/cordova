__@osaintilien55__ says 
> In a cordova app let say a user uses a search function and gets in return a search result list and then clicks on one of the results and it takes them to another Html page...Now is there a way for the user to hit back and return to that same search result list that was there previously without having it disappear? Currently when I test this in the browser hitting back will bring me to an empty search list but the keyword that was searched is still in the input field.
