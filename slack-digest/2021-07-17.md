__@asskar__ says 
> Hi, i am trying to achieve automatic url redirection (interception and remapping to local files) on cordova-ios ( on Android its done with overriding remapUri in the plugin code and resourceApi), on iOS overriding shouldOverrideLoadWithRequest doesn't give the same functionality, the method is called only once if YES is returned, if NO is returned and a remapped url is passed to WebViewEngine via loadRequest  it loops infinitely, i haven't found any examples of how to achieve this in WKWebview, some examples are there for the old UIWebView.
> Environment : Vuejs + Cordova.
> Somehow only the first url (which is a static index.html, with a file:// protocol) gets the "decidePolicyForNavigationAction" call, where the shouldOverrideLoadWithRequest is checked for each plugin.
> Anybody has an idea how to do this ?
> Thanks
