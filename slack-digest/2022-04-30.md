> Hey everyone, within the last few hours has anyone started seeing this message `Invalid 'main' field in '/Users/vagrant/git/node_modules/objectorarray/package.json' of 'dist/index.js'. Please either fix that or report it to the module author` followed by `Failed to fetch plugin {plugin@version} via registry.` when installing plugins? I started getting it unexpectedly just within the past hour.

__@norman137__ says 
> <https://github.com/indentjs/objectorarray> Based on what's in their repository, package is set to `dist/index.js` but that doesn't exists in the repo, nor do I see any build script to build a distribution version of the library.

> Additionally, NPM has a version 1.0.5, which doesn't seem to be pushed to the repo.
