__@jalidjinou__ says 
> Hi all.
> I got an angular project that i used with cordova to generate ios and android app.
> I integrated a button that transform to counter while recording audio. I used RecordRTC for the web but since it is not working on mobile i integrated cordova-plugin-audio-recorder-api, cordova-plugin-audio-recorder, cordova-plugin-audioinput but when i generate the mobile apps it only works on android and not on IOS.
> Any help ?

__@norman137__ says 
> So if `RecordRTC` relies on the browser implementation of webrtc (which I assume it is if it's for the web), it will probably only work on iOS 14.3 devices or later.

__@norman137__ says
