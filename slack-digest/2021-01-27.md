> @norman137 / @niklasmerz / @timbru one of my colleague said today on daily meeting, that I do not need IAB anymore since cordova v10 ? because this is a part of cordova now and once what i need is using normal `window.open(url, '_blank')`…. do I missing something in release-emails or documentation? 🙂

__@mattwenner1__ says 
> Has anyone ever ran into an issue where font awesome icons stopped working only on the android app, but on a physical device?  It works fine on an android simulator though.  Spinning my wheels a bit, I don’t have a physical android device to try to debug.  Is there an easy way I could have the person experiencing the issue debug it with the chrome dev tools?

__@chadwick.blackford__ says 
> @mattwenner1 create a debug apk and run it, after that open dev tools  and check what was wrong

__@mattwenner1__ says 
> I’m running into: “You uploaded a debuggable APK. For security reasons you need to disable debugging before it can be published in Google Play-Upload apk to google play”.  Which is understandable….but I need to get it to a non developer with the android device to test

__@norman137__ says

__@norman137__ says
