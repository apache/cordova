> What part of OneSignal SDK violates the Child Apps Policy? You should be able to use OneSignal (or any other push notification) provided that the app handles parental consent and permissions properly. <https://onesignal.com/tos#:~:text=Compliance%20with%20COPPA%20%3A%20OneSignal%20permits,or%20other%20contact%20information%20to>

__@chris.khong__ says 
> Hi guys, I’m working on the PR <https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-media-capture/pull/215|#215> for the issue <https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-media-capture/issues/210|#210>, for the media-capture plugin regarding Android 11 Storage updates. Currently I am trying to use `androidx.core.content.FileProvider`instead of the old version `android.support.v4.content.FileProvider`because it will be deprecated soon. Anyone has an idea how I can enable AndroidX from media-capture plugin configuration, travis was complaining that I need to enable AndroidX in gradle.properties. I can do that if I used <https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter|cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter>, but that way the media-capture plugin will be dependent on another plugin, which should not be a preferable way.
