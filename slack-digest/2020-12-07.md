> Hi team , While using file transfer upload method I am facing exceptions viz "Error getting HTTP status code from connection.
>     <http://javax.net|javax.net>.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found." From server side which are the configurations that needs to be verified and while on cordova app do I need some configurations for ssl or some certificate or do I need to import some certificate ? If yes then what is the procedure? I am not clear about configurations if they are from backend or frontend. Thanks &amp; Kind Regards ,Pratiksha.
