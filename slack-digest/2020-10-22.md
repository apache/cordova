> Hi All - In my case I am using Iphone 11 pro Max.
> In our hybrid application we open a login url and get back login response in our application.
> So using _self will not solve our purpose.
> Earlier it was working fine with _blank but suddenly in latest Iphones it stoped working.. using _self opens login url in InappBrowser but do not return response to original app.
> Kindly give me some solution on this.
