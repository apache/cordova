__@cashamir__ says 
> So I just created a new project in Cordova, anyone that can tell me why the device ready event works on localhost (browser platform) but not when i transfer the files from the "www" folder into a subfolder on my domain

__@norman137__ says 
> I'm not that familiar with the browser platform and it is quite a bit different than the other "native" platforms, but a `deviceready` event is suppose to fire once all plugins are initialized.

__@norman137__ says

> This is confusing me, you don't create a `cordova.js` file, it's supplied to you. The file would be located in `&lt;cordova-project&gt;/platforms/browser/www`, which is where your source code is copied to when you build/run the "browser" platform.

__@erisu__ says 
> Just for a side note: As far as I am aware, the deprecated cordova-plugin-whitelist plugin does not support the browser platform. Installing it or setting AllowList configs would not make a difference. The plugin it self only added functionality to Android. iOS had it integrated in core. And Android, as of 10.x, has it integrated and relabeled as AllowList.

__@erisu__ says

Fri, 10 Sep 2021 14:24:02 GMT

__@cashamir__ says 
> @erisu Thank you for the side note, I'm not really sure about that to be honest. The main reason i started looking at Cordova, was that i need the ability to control the keyboard on phone devices.

__@erisu__ says

Fri, 10 Sep 2021 14:32:52 GMT

__@cashamir__ says

__@cashamir__ says

__@erisu__ says 
> If deploying to a web server and expecting users to access though a browser mobile or desktop, you will be limit you to only what is available with web APIs and what ever that browser supports..

Fri, 10 Sep 2021 14:39:06 GMT

__@cashamir__ says
