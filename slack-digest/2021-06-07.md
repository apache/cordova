__@marek.kozela__ says 
> Hi everyone, is there a possibility to build, for example, cordova ios app and make changes in code using IDE and see live results in app? So that I do not have to always rebuild app with new changes in code. Or more specifically: Is there a replacement for cordova-plugin-livereload? Thanks for help.

__@ariel.magno__ says 
> Hi, this is how my index file looks like and for some reason, the css and js file cant be found when running the cordova app. In the file explorer view on the right, we can verify that the files exist but in the browser, it says the files cannot be found. Am I missing something?
