__@norman137__ says 
> Based on <https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/blob/master/www/inappbrowser.js>

> You can't. The plugin doesn't store a variable to keep track of the status, nor offers an API to get the status from the native.

> You're best workaround is probably to create an abstraction so that your application doesn't use the in app browser APIs directly and instead call on your own class, which you can easily implement a variable to hold that information.

__@dpogue__ says

__@dpogue__ says

__@mikic.alek__ says 
> Hi guys, did anyone else experience viewport displacement after updating XCode and Android studio? I am a complete amateur in this, so I have no idea where to start, so I´d appreciate any hint. I posted it here: <https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/issues/1152>

__@norman137__ says 
> Well it's css that's responsible for positioning your content. What css do you have that makes you think it should be positioned centered in the screen?

__@timbru__ says 
> I’d say this is a CSS problem, too, since it affects all “when building from both Windows and macOS, on all Android and iOS versions I could test on.”

__@norman137__ says

> Glancing through it though, I don't see anything that looks like you're trying to center anything, except for `h1` text.

__@norman137__ says

__@mikic.alek__ says

Tue, 19 Jan 2021 17:21:53 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Alternatively, you can use the position absolute trick for centering: <https://jsfiddle.net/x5cfvk78/1/>

__@norman137__ says 
> Or maybe favourite, using flexbox: <https://jsfiddle.net/x5cfvk78/2/> but flexbox can be tricky to get right sometimes.
