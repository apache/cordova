__@norman137__ says 
> If the library operates inside the webview environment, there's no guarentee the OS will not pause webview processes when the app is a background. `keepRunning` is a flag that acts more like a hint, but the OS may not honour it and actual behaviour may vary by device. Also note that this for Android only. iOS always pauses any webview activity when the app goes into the background.
