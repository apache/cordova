__@ananya__ says 
> Hi Guys, I am using cordova-plugin-inappbrowser to redirect to a URL inside the app. I have a requirement to intercept few URLs and I'm using `beforeload` event to do the same. It works fine in android. But when I try to do the same in iOS, it opens a blank page.
> 
> What I'm currently using is
> 
> `window.cordova.InAppBrowser.open("&lt;url&gt;","_blank","location=no,beforeload=yes")`
> 
> While the URL loads successfully *without* `beforeload=yes` , it shows a blank page when used *with* `beforeload=yes`
> 
> I have also raised an issue in github about the same. (<https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/issues/809>)
> 
> Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
