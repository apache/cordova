__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hi folks are network requests from the webview fully compatible with tls? I'm using the advanced http plugin right now but it has some drawbacks that I would like to avoid if the webview's `fetch` API is fully compatible with ssl. I can see the ssl step in the network tab when I send the request but I'd like a second opinion. Thanks!
