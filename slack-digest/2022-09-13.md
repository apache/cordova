__@norman137__ says 
> K, that's what I kinda thought. If that's the case, I assume the first plugin that has the dependency, it will install the latest version that satisfies the specified semver, and then when it installs another plugin that declares the same version, it must check if the dependency is already installed and that the installed version satisfies it's specified semver... and if not, then it's a conflict. At least I hope that's how it works. I guess I'll test and confirm the behaviour tomorrow.
