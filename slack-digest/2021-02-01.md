__@norman137__ says 
> inappbrowser open wit `_blank` works. `window.open()` with `_blank` (did not test any other configurations) doesn't work, at least not from console. But using `window.open` in your websites is not recommended to begin with

__@norman137__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> Do you know if `window.open()` is used as a response of a user gesture (like a click event)?
> 
> Haven't tested this but based on some reading, Safari will ignore `window.open` if not invoked as a user gesture response. This means `window.open` must be within a callstack from a user-initiated event. It can't be called asynchronously either.

__@norman137__ says 
> I just tested it... and it doesn't work in IAB, but it does work in safari browser.
