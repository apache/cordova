__@daviesd__ says 
> Does anyone know if something has changed with splash screens?  I see my app currently in the app store (built over a year ago) is briefly showing a black screen before the splash screen.  Rebuilding with the latest cordova-ios also shows the same problem.  I've started work on a Capacitor app as well, and I see discussions about it not working there either.  Something about the splash screen storyboards.  Anyone seen this?

__@daviesd__ says 
> ok, i don't even know what that means, but I'll look it up. ðŸ™‚  Ya, I'm betting there is some new screen resolution requirement that has come out since all the max sizes.  let me look at the xcode project (something I rarely do on my Cordova project, but it looks like Capacitor is gonna force me to).

__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hi folks, is there a specific method that's used to re-initialize/re-render the webview on Android when the device returns to the foreground and the `deviceresume` event is fired? There's a full-page flicker that I get when returning to my app, like the full viewport is re-rendered. I've confirmed that disabling hardware acceleration prevents it. Following @norman137â€™s suggestion I created a plugin that disables hardware rendering when the app is put in the background, and re-enables it when the app is restored to the foreground. This works partially because there seems to be a race condition between when my plugin re-enables hardware rendering and when the source of the flicker is triggered: if my plugin re-enables before the flicker would happen, then it's like hardware acceleration was never turned off and the flicker still happens. So I'm considering how to identify the exact point at which the flicker is getting triggered, and I'm suspecting that it's something in the native code that's causing it (the problem happens even if I strip my app down to a single absolutely positioned node in dev tools, so I don't think it's a problem from within the webview). Open to any ideas, thanks!
