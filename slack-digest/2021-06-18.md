__@aidanas__ says 
> Hi all, quick question. Why does `cordova platform add electron`  adds `cordova-electron@1.0.0`  if there has already been version `2.0.0`  out for some while. Even NPM lists as `2.0.0`  as current version <https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-electron>. Is there anything iâ€™m missing in configuration?
