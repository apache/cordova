__@hayley.dawson__ says 
> Hi all, strange question (maybe). I am tasked with building a cordova plugin for the rest of my team. However, I'm struggling to get the IDE we use (Intellij Idea) to recognize that the cordova files exist. Any suggestions? (I'm willing to swap to a different IDE as well). I also noticed that cordova thinks the project isn't a cordova project, but it is a plugin with the plugin.xml...which doesn't appear to need to have config.xml?
