I've been reading about the `cordova.js` file that gets generated when you build the app. I've done that, and I've included the `cordova.js` file in my `index.html` but its still complaining. I can see in the network tab that this magical JS file has loaded... Is there somewhere I can read about this? I'm really stuck and I've only just started getting going. I'm using cordova 10.0.0 and AndroidStudio 4.0.1

__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hey folks, in theory what would be the effect of modifying `cordova.js` to mark plugin scripts as async when injecting them? I can expect this to bring `DOMContentLoaded` forward, but I'm not certain what effect it would have on when `pluginsReady` fires, which blocks when `deviceready` fires. Also, assuming this strategy helps reduce load time, would this be a good idea to try in a production app considering that the cordova team probably has a good reason for not already doing this? I'm considering different things to improve my app's load time and I can see in dev tools that the time to parse plugin scripts is one of the bottlenecks. Unfortunately I have plugins that load multiple scripts (38 scripts for one particular plugin) but they are essential to my app's functionality.

> Has anyone dealt with issues publishing scoped public packages to the npm registry?  I keep getting an error, "You must sign up for private packages" when running the command, "npm publish --access public".  I just don't understand why npm seems to be treating this package as private.  All of the support around this error really seems clear that this would be resolved by specifying the "access" flag.
