__@zach657__ says 
> I’ve only recently discovered `cordova-paramedic` <https://github.com/apache/cordova-paramedic> as a testing tool for plugin development. This tool is amazing and I believe is going to change our efficiency of plugin development. Specifically when a new SDK (or `cordova-&lt;platform&gt;`) is released.
> 
> My concern is that it seems abandoned. I had to fork and make several changes to introduce support for `cordova-android@10`  Is there a replacement for `cordova-paramedic` ?  Or can I get some help to incorporate the changes needed for `cordova-android@10` into this main repo?

__@zach657__ says 
> This is one PR that I just opened.
> <https://github.com/apache/cordova-paramedic/pull/214>
> 
> It specifically solves one problem. However there is at least one more change that is needed for running `cordova-paramedic --platform android@10.1.0 --plugin cordova-plugin-statusbar` to succeed.
> 
> One other change required is:
> Allowing insecure (HTTP) is necessary for `cordova-paramedic` to work, because the <https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-test-framework|cordova-plugin-test-framework> scripts running in the cordova environment, need to post (HTTP PUT) test results to the local server of `cordova-paramedic`, awaiting the results.

Thu, 26 Aug 2021 18:44:06 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> Paramedic was meant as a CI test runner for the official Apache-maintained plugins, but flaky tests and a decrease in active contributors have led to it mostly being unmaintained. I'm not sure how much stuff is still using it, and I personally don't have any experience with it.
