> Hi team , While using cordova.plugins.notification.local I am able to set notification for a particular date with hr &amp; min i.e trigger: { every: { month: 10, day: 27, hour: 9, minute: 0 } } , but I m looking out for functionality which helps to set notification for a time span i.e providing startDate &amp; endDate as input in trigger. How can this be achieved ? If any one came across any such scenarios do let me know. Thanks &amp; Kind Regards,Pratiksha
