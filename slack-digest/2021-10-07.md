> Well I rather think about logging for remote issue analysis. Lets say we release our app to 1000 users and some face some issue. We need to collect as much diagnostic data as possible. Logs are common diagnostic data.

> On the other hand this does not capture application errors which does not cause crash. I assume that I have to facilitate custom logging on our own for those.
