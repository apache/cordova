__@info460__ says 
> excuse another question, but looks like I am hitting every possible roadblock.
> I am developing simple geocache app for whole family (like to be children friendly, no ads, no analytics, no private data collection).
> I just got message from google that I cant use G map Api if app is directed towards children.
> Anyone know what will be the best course of action to solve this?
> 1. I really dont like the idea making the app adult only (not suitable for children and families)
> 2. I know that Google does not really care about small devs, so probably apeal is not good idea
> 3. I can see multiple app.in.Google play using G maps with PEGI3 ranking
> I am kind of desperate as I did not imagine this can be a problem.
> Any comment on this really welcome
> thank you

__@norman137__ says 
> Language around this is always vague and such a gray area, but basically if your app so much appeals to children (via graphics that appear to be children friendly) then you must mark your app as appeals to children.
> 
> Example of such graphics could be the use of bright colours or fancy fonts, cartoons, etc... <https://www.google.com/search?q=children+apps&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsZaFJkhJ13H3pUWNuJ_qA3kISHKHQ:1657929827549&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiszbvzjfz4AhXFpIkEHVQFBT8Q_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=867&amp;dpr=1> for examples.

> Other issues could be app description.

> Basically you have to declare that your app could not be mistaken as a childrens app.
> 
> And if you are building a childrens app, then there are several additional legal challenges involved around privacy, in most countries.

__@norman137__ says 
> This isn't something I dealt with before... but I would objectively take a deep look at all marketing details (anything that would appear in the app store), and the general design of your app itself, with the lens of "could this be mistaken for a children's app?"
> 
> And if so, make changes necessary then request an appeal, otherwise... I guess see if you can appeal.

__@info460__ says 
> so does that mean (if I mark the app as designed  for and with appeal to children, because it is) that I cant use G Maps API at all?
> App is already marked as App for kids

> only visible options I can see
> 1. do not use Google maps at all

__@dpogue__ says 
> It sounds like the issue here is that Google Maps collects a bunch of tracking information about GPS and stuff, and they're not legally allowed to collect that for kids, so they opted to just not allow using their API in those cases rather than allow people to turn off tracking

__@norman137__ says 
> open street maps is an open source database. The data used to produce their map tiles are all volunteer driven and it's open / free (with conditions obviously)

> OSM doesn't have a map library itself, but there are a number of different Map libraries available. Leaflet is one of hte more common, simple libraries.

__@norman137__ says 
> The biggest drawback with OSM compared to google maps is that android gmaps has a tilecache so you can use maps whlie offline, and chances are (thanks to an existing app on the device, such as the Google Maps app itself, it already has the tiles downloaded and cached).
