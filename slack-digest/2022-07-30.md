> Hi folks, I'm running into issues trying to use a <https://github.com/havesource/cordova-plugin-push/blob/master/plugin.xml#L131-L138|plugin that has a Cocoapods dependency>, from a corporate environment where our Pods are delivered via a JFrog Artifactory proxy (the public Cocoapods repo is blocked by our corporate firewall).
> 
> To use the JFrog Cocoapods server, you're supposed to modify your `Podfile` to include a plugin definition, <https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/CocoaPods+Repositories#CocoaPodsRepositories-Usingcocoapods-art|as defined here>:
> 
> ```plugin 'cocoapods-art', :sources =&gt; [
>         '&lt;local_specs_repo_name&gt;'
>  ]```
> My problem: I'm seeing is that when the `&lt;podspec&gt;`  runs for a plugin, the `Podfile` gets created, and Cordova immediately performs `pod install`. This fails, because I haven't updated the `Podfile` to include the plugin above, and it times out trying to hit the public registry.
> 
> Any thoughts? I don't see an easy way to work around this. Ideally there'd be an option in `cordova-ios` that lets me defer the `pod install` , or another option in `podspec` to let me add plugins to the `Podfile`, but without a change like this, I'm stuck.
