__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hi folks ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜„  does anyone know how to close the browser's native HTML date picker using any vanilla JS methods? I'm referring to a native datetime picker like this one for Android shown in the screenshot (for an `&lt;input type="datetime-local" /&gt;`). I've tried different things and seen different suggestions including changing theÂ `type`Â of the input field, settingÂ `display: none`Â on the input field, replacing the input field (`node.outerHTML = node.outerHTML`), blurring the input field (`node.blur()`), setting its value to an empty string, and giving itÂ `type="hidden"`. But none of these have worked. Whatever change I make to the element in the DOM, the native picker is unaffected and remains on the screen.

__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Also has anyone experienced a flash when returning to the app after it was put in the background? I've tried removing node in the `&lt;body&gt;` except for script tags and a single `&lt;div&gt;`, but the flash still happens. I thought it was plugins but I've created a sample app with the same plugins and I don't see the flash in the sample app. I've tried commenting out everything in my `onDeviceResume` handler and yet the flash happens, so I'm not sure what else could be at play. Anyone have any ideas I could explore? Thanks :simple_smile: .

__@lukas__ says 
> Does it make sense to download plugins locally to make them install faster (we often wipe the cordova folder completely)? For example the Facebook plugin takes a couple of minutes to install (<https://github.com/jeduan/cordova-plugin-facebook4>)

__@erisu__ says 
> I think downloading that plugin package and installing it from a local copy will not exactly solve your problem. The pluginâ€™s npm package, itself, is only 61.4 kB. That shouldnâ€™t take long. I think its the third-party libraries that it is downloading for the build. Those iOS pods and Gradle libraries could be large.
