> Hi! Just wanted to introduce myself and say thanks for all of your work on Cordova. I've been using it for years and it's great! I just published my first plugin, it generates application icons from a SVG source file (the idea of manually generating them all was exhausting). Hopefully it will show up on the plugin search, but here's the package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-iconbuild>
