__@norman137__ says 
> I'd try refreshing the webview, which you can do by connecting the Safari web inspector to the app and pressing cmd+r while the inspector is focused. If the error only occurs after resuming, hopefully it will also trigger on refreshing, or perhaps it's a race condition. Either way, if you can get the error to trigger **while** the inspector is connected it may provide a bit more insight, including a stacktrace of what is making the call to the cordova api.

Mon, 24 Jan 2022 13:31:15 GMT

__@jac.darby__ says
