__@n.linnemann__ says 
> Hello there, I have a problem with events on iOS using cordova. Namely, that the blur event is not triggered.
> The cordova application is built using VueJS. The focus event and input event and so on is triggered, but not the blur event.
> 
> Is there some configuration or whatever I have to add?

__@mathewp.94__ says 
> I did some across one issue.
> 
> I was calling up some native permission dialogs, one after the other, using  `cordova.plugins.diagnostic` and `cordova-plugin-idfa`  and the second dialog stopped showing for iOS 15.
> 
> I guess previously the dialogs were kind of 'queued up' but there no longer are.
> 
> So after waiting for the first dialog to close (as I was before) I have set an additional timeout of 500ms which seems to do the trick and allow the second dialog to show correctly.
