__@ebrommers__ says 
> I recently upgraded to cordova-android 10.x and AndroidX, and have been getting empty cordova-plugin-file file set results from DirectoryReader.ReadEntries() (It’ll return the directories, but no files). I’ve got both READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE defined and the post-Android 6.x runtime permissions set (using cordova.plugins.diagnostic requestExternalStorageAuthorization). Is there something else I need to be doing with the new scoped storage?
