> Hello! I'm stuck on one issue and my deadline is almost over.
> So, I'm trying to make a http request to local network and I received the following error:
> ```Preflight response is not successful
> XMLHttpRequest cannot load <http://192.168.4.1/list> due to access control checks.
> Failed to load resource: Preflight response is not successful```
> My request:
> ```   axios
>     .get('<http://192.168.4.1/list>')
>     .then(res =&gt; {
>      console.log(res)
>     }).catch((err) =&gt; {
>      if (err.status === 500) {
>       // error
>      } else {
>       // error
>      }
>     })```
> I tried to set some headers to this request like Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, Access-Control-Allow-Methods. Unfortunately it didn’t work.
> 
> This issue is only in iOS app. In android app or browsers the request works properly.
> 
> Can anyone help me? Thanks!
