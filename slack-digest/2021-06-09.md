__@drouard.noelie__ says 
> Hello 🙂 I don't know if you can help me, but I am trying to link my app with my website. I use the customURLscheme plugin.
> I can open the app by clicking on a link in my mails, but the app only opens the main page, even though the link is supposed to autoconnect the user and then take him/her to the page.
> I have a handleOpenUrl function that I put in the main.ts file, in the onDeviceReady event, but it seems it doesn't go there at all. (I am testing on Android). Did someone have this problem too?

__@erikyuzwa__ says 
> Would appreciate any input on "build environment" strategies. I'm currently making a build for TestFlight, then needing to rebuild and upload for something that can be promoted to release. ie. due to flipping test web services and/or flags that are used within TestFlight to the non-test web service calls for production.
