__@janek.beicher__ says 
> Hey! I'm currently trying to upgrade to cordova-android v10 and did so via Ionic-Cli. Upgrading and everything worked fine, I did it via
> ```cordova platform remove android
> cordova platform add android@10.0.1```
> new cordova version is added in package.json etc. But if I delete the `platforms` and `plugins` and run `ionic cordova platform add android`    (Which would be done in CI) it  tries to install an old version of cordova android:
> ```&gt; cordova platform add android
> Using cordova-fetch for cordova-android@^9.0.0```
> I tried already to reinstall cordova (10.0.0) and also to update to latest ionic cli but the issue seems to be cordova? Also running `cordova platforms list` seems to result in outdated info:
> ```Available platforms: 
>   android ^9.0.0
>   browser ^6.0.0
>   electron ^1.0.0
>   ios ^6.1.0
>   osx ^6.0.0```
> any suggestions how to fix this? 🙏

__@norman137__ says 
> If you don't specify a version, it will use a pre-configured default major, which for cordova cli v10, it's cordova-android@^9.

__@janek.beicher__ says 
> Alright! So there is no way to make sure via config that ci and colleagues are using the correct version? Also what's the purpose of adding it to package.json then? Do you think this would make a valid feature request? then I'd open one

__@norman137__ says 
> With older cordova CLI versions, pinning used to be done via `config.xml` using the `&lt;engine&gt;` tag... which might still work (not sure tbh)
> 
> Newer CLI versions relies more on NPM to manage those details. By doing `cordova platform remove android` behind-the-scenes does a `npm uninstall` which by default removes the entry from package.json, effectively removing your version pin. This may be an oversight.
> 
> I think the platform command does expose a `--no-save` flag, so you could also try `cordova platform remove android --no-save`

__@norman137__ says 
> eh -- just tested it, the `--no-save` flag stil seems to remove it from package.json

__@erisu__ says 
> Can’t guarantee the `engine` tag will remain for ever since we been moving these dependencies to `package.json` . It might be removed in the future.
