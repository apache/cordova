__@timbru__ says 
> Alright, swarm intelligence needed. ðŸ™‚
> Any idea why Travis and SauceLabs do not work together anymore? Even with the tunnel setup, it seems the SauceLabs VM can't reach the (proxied) localhost server on Travis. Without any changes, this stopped working in the past month.
> Thins I've already tried without success:
> - Upgrade relevant dependencies, such as, wd, sauce-connect-launcher, local-server
> - Tried different OS on Travis CI
> - Let Travis setup the tunnel with their add-on
> - Moved the legacy setup to be W3C WebDriver compliant
> - Upgraded Browser versions of Chrome and Firefox to the current latest and the OS to macOS 10.15/Windows 10
> - Even tried spinning up a localhost server with the serve npm module to ensure the issue is not within cordova-browser.
> - Messed around with different proxy settings of the W3C spec. (PAC; direct, non at all)
> *I assume a TravisCI issue, because it works when running locally against SauceLabs.*

> One random question I have as per appStore's warning for uiwebview we have upgraded to ios latest version to update from uiwebview to wkwebview . Is there any such changes in android ? Or android code still remains the same ? As for ios webview plugin is obsolete.
