__@ppetree__ says 
> AndroidX: I've been away from this for a while so I'm sure this subject has been beat to death but I have a build problem (as in I can't build) and I can't find a workaround.
> 
> Essentially, my config.xml has these settings:
> ```    &lt;preference name="android-minSdkVersion" value="22" /&gt;
>     &lt;preference name="android-targetSdkVersion" value="29" /&gt;
>     &lt;preference name="AndroidXEnabled" value="true" /&gt;
>     &lt;preference name="JetifierEnabled" value="true" /&gt;
>     &lt;plugin name="cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter" spec="1.1.3" /&gt;
>     &lt;plugin name="cordova-android-play-services-gradle-release" spec="4.0.0" /&gt;```
> When I build I get the following errors on several packages:
> ```error: package android.support.annotation does not exist
> import android.support.annotation.NonNull;
>                                  ^
> error: package android.support.v4.content does not exist
> import android.support.v4.content.PermissionChecker;
>                                  ^
> error: package android.support.annotation does not exist

> import android.support.v4.content.PermissionChecker;
>                                  ^```
> What's the solution?

__@norman137__ says 
> It's my understanding that `cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter` was suppose to translate those to the androidx equivalent classes.

__@norman137__ says 
> You could find out which packages are using the old support libraries and fork them. Upgrading them to androidx **should** be relatively simple...

> Class Mapping -&gt; <https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate/class-mappings>

> If the plugin is using version 28 of the old support libraries, then you can upgrade to version 1.0.0 to androidx, which is binary identical to the old android support library classes, other then the namespaces.

> I can see I'm gonna have to ditch cloud build services and go local... I have a macbook air but zero idea how to configure it for cordova and none of the documentation comes close to getting me going... sigh.

__@norman137__ says 
> I'd recommend installing Node14, via <https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm>
> Then install xcode from the App Store
> Then install cordova via `npm install cordova -g`
> Then install `ios-deploy` via `npm install ios-deploy -g` (I think this needs to have xcode installed on the machine first)
> 
> After that you should be able to successfully build and run an ios project...
> 
> ```cordova create test
> cd test
> cordova platform add ios
> cordova run ios```

__@ppetree__ says 
> (I'm surprised no one has built an electron app to install and maintain all this, to add plugins, to perform builds etc).

> Ok, I'm down to this error:
> ```Execution failed for task ':app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac'.
> &gt; Compilation failed; see the compiler error output for details.```
> Which is occurring with @havesource/cordova-plugin-push. Sigh...

__@norman137__ says 
> Is that what those old support libraries errors are coming from? I know there are some people working on making that plugin use &amp; depend on androidx.
