> I'm not familiar with next.js but based on a short description:
> 
> &gt; Next.js is an open-source React front-end development web framework created by Vercel that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications. 
> While it is possible to load your webview from a remote source, it's not recommended. Code that is loaded in remotely isn't allowed to call on any native APIs (either directly or indirectly) by the Apple &amp; Google store policies and it's harder to handle cases such as if the user is offline.
> 
> If next.js supports rendering a static website at "compile time" so that it produces a set of html / css / js files, then that would work great with Cordova. After all, Cordova is really just a packaging tool that packages your web assets in a native shell and loads those web assets into a webview.
