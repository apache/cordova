__@harel.mazor__ says 
> Well, not surprisingly, I added the above "fix" and got compilation errors due to lack of androidX support in some plugins I use. One of them I maintain, so that shouldn't be an issue, the other one is out of my hands. Is the androidx-adapter plugin should solve all the androidX issues? do I need to enable androidX now (I understood it's by default now)? Do I need to enable jetifier?

__@norman137__ says 
> As of cordova-android@10, androidx is forcefully on. The rationale behind this is because Google kinda made it impossible to support both androidx &amp; legacy support libraries at the same time. We'd basically need to fork the platform if we wanted to support both. This problem also extended to plugin authors.

__@harel.mazor__ says 
> I have no problem with this step. I knew it was coming when I decided to upgrade. I just hoped if I waited long enough most issues will be resolved in the adapter and plugins. This isn't the case apparently. I couldn't find a good guide for upgrading a plugin to use androidX. Are you familiar with such a guide. The following plugin is the one I maintain:

Mon, 27 Sep 2021 13:14:19 GMT

__@harel.mazor__ says 
> I'm looking at the plugin code and it seems that it uses a preference variable to determine the com.android.support version, which might cause the adapter to fail. the other plugin that fails is the email composer plugin.

Mon, 27 Sep 2021 13:19:56 GMT

__@norman137__ says

__@harel.mazor__ says 
> Well, I'm out of time for now. @norman137 thank you very very much for the support you are giving here, it's not given. I'll see if I can make my plugin support androidX shortly and create a PR or a fork of the email plugin.

__@harel.mazor__ says

Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:00:10 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Think the only reason why it hasn't been formally announced yet (dev docs does mark the platform as deprecated currently), is waiting for a suitable replacement, whether that by via cataylst, or I could see electron platform being a good candidate as well, but it still needs work to have electron implementations for plugins.

__@marek.kozela__ says 
> hi everyone, can someone help me how to change pipeline process because I have the following error: _Installed Build Tools revision 31.0.0 is corrupted. Remove and install again using the SDK Manager._ We are using the cordova-android 9.1.0. Based on my investigation I found out that this is fixed in cordova-android version 10.0.0, but we cannot upgrade to this version because that change will cause to update all other plugins and dependenciesâ€¦ Is there a workaround for this? Thanks a lot.
