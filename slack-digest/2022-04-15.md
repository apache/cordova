> Hello, I would like to ask whether is it possible to configure cordova to mimic custom domain when serving local files?

__@pawelkolodziej81__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> Android has something called WebViewAssetLoader which is implemented in cordova-android@10. It "hijacks" a domain so-to-speak and makes it appear as if the assets are coming from a specific domain that you choose. By default, this is just simply `localhost`. You can't however specify your own SSL certificate (and there shouldn't be a need to either). The WebViewAssetLoader essentially serves as a proxy to the local filesystem, so that you don't use the `file://` protocol directly. I choose the word "hijack" earlier because if you had a real server reachable at a domain, then your app won't be able to reach your real server using that domain if it's the domain you choose for your local content. Unlike iOS, you can only choose between `http` and `https` schemes.

> iOS has something similar as well. I'm not that knowledgable on the ios native stuff. I don't recall what it's called on the native end, but allows you to specify a protocol and a domain to load your web assets from, like the android counterpart. One distinct difference however is that you can't choose well-known protocols, including `http` or `https`, among others. By default cordova will use `app://` for iOS.

__@pawelkolodziej81__ says

__@pawelkolodziej81__ says 
> localhost in such case is not specific so it would be nice to support special dedicated domain which i own certificate for.

__@norman137__ says 
> Anybody can choose any domain for the purpose of their own app schemes so that metric isn't satisfactory if you're trying to lock down to acceptable callers to only your app.

> Keep in mind that CORS is a security-feature for end browser users, it's not a security feature for servers.

__@pawelkolodziej81__ says

__@pawelkolodziej81__ says

__@norman137__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> CORS doesn't really have any value in cordova apps, but we have no way to disable the protocol in the underlying web browser.

__@norman137__ says

__@norman137__ says

__@pawelkolodziej81__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> I know native libraries tends to use app id and signatures as well, like google maps for example will only work on the apps that has the app id that I allow the key to have access to, and the app must be signed with the keystore that matches the signature that I've provided but I'm not sure how they can accomplish that securely tbh.
