__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hi folks, I'm having an issue with sending POST requests from my app to my API server. I always get this error:
> &gt; Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
> This screenshot shows the CORS-handling code at the API server. It's based on this article: <https://breautek.com/2020/07/14/enabling-cors/>
> You can see that I do have logic to set the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header. When I perform the same fetch requests from the console in regular webpages, the requests are successful. So it seems the problem is from the app. Any ideas? Thanks!
> 
> PS: the `console.log` statements are not executed, it's almost like the CORS middleware is never hit when I make the request from my app, but it's hit when using a regular webpage or Postman.

__@dharmon__ says 
> Can someone help me with an issue I am having with a Cordova version upgrade? I am getting a common error that is `Using "requireCordovaModule" to load non-cordova module "fs" is not supported. Instead, add this module to your dependencies and use regular "require" to load it.` I tried looking up what this issue was (common issue with upgrade to Cordova 9), but I wasnâ€™t able to find anything that helped my specific case. I did a code-wide search for `requireCordovaModule`, but I did not find anything. Anyone know what I might need to do? Is this possibly coming from one of my plugins?

__@prasunjajodia__ says 
> Hi guys,
> I'm working on an electron project (for windows) where I use nodeRT geolocation.
> I had issues with some computers not being able to run the it because they don't have VC redistributable installed so they don't have the required DLL files
> <https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT/issues/87|This issue> shows how we can copy the required DLL files into the win_unpacked directory. But everytime I do, `cordova build electron --release` removes it. It doesn't help if I keep it in the original www directory either. Any way I can add it to win_unpacked before the build?
