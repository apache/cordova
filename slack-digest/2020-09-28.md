__@osaintilien55__ says 
> So I have this code at the bottom of my JavaScript, however when I scroll I am not getting any feedback. I've read elsewhere that "Height 100%" on Html and body usually cause this but I have since removed them however the problem is still there. Any ideas as to why? Also, doing window.pageYOffset, always returns 0 for some reason.
