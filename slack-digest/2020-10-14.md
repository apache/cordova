__@kornelux1__ says 
> Is it possible to attach `extraResources` like assets folder to the `cordova-electron` build process? It's possible in `electron-builder` but I can't find any information how to do it in `cordova-electron`.

__@tomkinson__ says 
> Anyone been on HTTP2 for a while and can report the worthwhilness of upgrading for multplexing? Was debating waiting for HTTP3 which I don't think is ready yet, but still being on HTTP1.1 with a complex media feed is...challenging

Tue, 13 Oct 2020 17:42:11 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> HTTP3 is not released yet. There's only a draft.
> 
> Http2 there is wide range support, and browsers that support http2 will use it if available, otherwise it will just fallback to http1.1. So there isn't really much to lose for enabling http2. While technically not required by the http2 spec, all major browsers implementations require encryption to use http2. If you're already have encryption setup, then it should be as easy as "flicking a switch"... at least it was for nginx.
> 
> Anecdotally we saw some improvements with multiplexing. There is a clear 100-200ms time save  between the initial connection that has to establish the TCP socket and subsequent connections that just reuses the initial TCP socket. But this wasn't something that was benchmarked or anything. We just "eyed it".

__@es.abdelaaziz__ says

__@norman137__ says

> I would first determine why it doesn't appear to work on the device. Knowing the error would be the first step to determine what your options are. Use the Chrome web inspector (for android) or the Safari Web Inspector (for iOS) to take a look at the javascript console.

__@dpogue__ says 
> The purpose of Cordova is firstly to package web apps for native app stores, and secondarily to provide access to native features that are missing from the web. So it's always best to try to do stuff with web technologies, and only reach for native plugins when absolutely necessary

Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:01:18 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says

Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:01:55 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says

Tue, 13 Oct 2020 15:17:15 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says

Tue, 13 Oct 2020 15:31:26 GMT

__@niklasmerz__ says 
> That should work. Make sure to delete the ios platform and add it like you said. Use convertFileUrl so use the proxy. File Transfer probably wont work because it does the connection natively

__@pablo.caselas__ says

Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:43:56 GMT

__@niklasmerz__ says 
> You could have a look at the PR above. It's not that complicated. It syncs the cookies with the Webview. If the other plugins do that too it might work
