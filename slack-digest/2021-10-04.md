> Hi, please excuse a question.l of Cordova and JS greenhorn 
> After my cordova apps seems to be quite slow Iam now scouting options to implement SPA into Cordova. I dont really like Ionic together with React,Vue,Angular as it seems to be overkill for what I want to do. I found Svelte (Svelte SPA router)
> Anyone know if possible to implement Svelte router into Cordova?

Sun, 03 Oct 2021 19:46:17 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> I can't speak for Svelte, but the key thing is if it supports hash-based routing.

__@norman137__ says 
> Nearly all traditional web frameworks will work pretty good in cordova, but ont caveat is cordova isn't powered by a web server. In a traditional SPA, there is some amount of desire to have "clean" looking urls, etc `<https://example.com/fancy-url>` instead of `<https://example.com/app#/some-url>`

Sun, 03 Oct 2021 19:48:20 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> But that only works with apps powered by a web server that knows how to redirect the fancy-url to your main index.html.

> With Cordova you don't have that web server, nor can users see the URL anyway.

Sun, 03 Oct 2021 19:48:47 GMT

__@norman137__ says

__@info460__ says

Sun, 03 Oct 2021 21:12:26 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> In my apps, I have a `&lt;cordova-project&gt;/src` folder, which contains all the sources for the web app. I use webpack to build a compiled app file into the `&lt;cordova-project&gt;/www` folder, which the `index.html` file references.

Sun, 03 Oct 2021 22:16:33 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Basically the `www` folder is for your final files to be packed and distributed with your app. I'm not familiar with svelte but any runtime files required to be ran with your app should be included in your `www` folder.

__@info460__ says 
> I am coming from.web development word and still surprises me how complex tooling needed for android development inside Cordova.
> 

Sun, 03 Oct 2021 23:58:47 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> To be fair, you can write a cordova app purely in HTML/JS without any frameworks or build tools. Cordova doesn't depend on webpack or any other framework... it's just simply a packaging tool at the end of the day... with the exception to the bridging API to provide the JS access to native APIs.
> 
> But like any web application, whether it be in a cordova container or hosted in a traditional web server -- you have to ask yourself if using  web frameworks will give you the scalability/maintainability for your app. For larger complex apps, the answer is probably yes.
> 

Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:03:21 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> For smaller projects, the added complexity of introducing frameworks may not make much sense. Like Angular, It is a fully fledged out application framework that is quite opinionated and has many assumptions, but provides you with a lot of tooling out of the box. It's a complicated framework intended for building quite large / robust applications... but like you said earlier, it's seems overkill for your particular project.

Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:28:52 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> There is a caveat with the camera permission though, where if the camera permission is declared in the AndroidManifest, then you must have the Camera permission granted to use the intent for capturing images -- even though the camera permission ins't necessary for that action.

Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:29:12 GMT

__@pawelkolodziej81__ says

Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:29:30 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:30:13 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:35:08 GMT

Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:41:24 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Ok... so in theory we could have a method signature such as `boolean onShowFileChooser(FileChooserParams)` where we return `true` if it's handled, `false` otherwise. The default implementation in `CordovaPlugin` could be simply return false.
> 
> Then we can iterate over the cordova plugins (which i'm not sure if this is possible from `SystemWebChromeClient`, we might need to delegate...). The first cordova plugin that returns true allows us to kick out of the loop and exit.
> 
> If no cordova plugins returns true, then we can fallback to the original behaviour.

> Not 100% sure if this flow will work, but think it might be a start...

__@norman137__ says

__@miroslav.vojtus__ says 
> Hello all. Do you have please a suggestion how to properly implement main process to web/browser notifications with the newest cordova-electron plugin system? I've learned it is possible to perfrom cordova.exec but I do not know how to do an observer pattern where web/browser observes events from a cordova-electron native nodejs main process.
> I guess there is no such a support yet and I have to override `cdv-electron-preload.js`  with some ipc + cordova/channel.

> Not that long ago Cordova-Electron was experimental and since 3.0, it finally released plugin support but I guess it just covered the main use cases that most plugins used. Theres is probably a lot of things missing or areas that could be improved. We might be able to achieve this without making changes to the core cordova-electron or the main process file…
