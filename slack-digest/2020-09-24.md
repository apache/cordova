__@owenocq__ says 
> I've done some more investigating in the splash screen issue I'm getting. So the splash screen image set appears correctly and instantly for a very short amount of time, then there's a white flash before WKView renders the css. I've tried adding to config.xml:
> 
> `&lt;preference name="SplashScreen" value="screen" /&gt;`
> `&lt;preference name="SplashMaintainAspectRatio" value="false" /&gt;`
> `&lt;preference name="AutoHideSplashScreen" value="false" /&gt;`
> `&lt;preference name="SplashScreenDelay" value="9000" /&gt;`
> `&lt;preference name="FadeSplashScreenDuration" value="5000" /&gt;`
> 
> But none are stopping the splash screen from disappearing. And I've tried adding this to onDeviceReady():  
> 
> ```if ( navigator.splashscreen ){ 
> 	navigator.splashscreen.show();
> } else { 
> 	console.log('I am not set');
> }```
> But the else not found is triggering.
> 
> Any clues wise Cordova people what is happening?
