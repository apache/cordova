> I am having this really problematic issue after migrating my api to a new server. When i check logs it says ssl error, tried to use the same mobile device chrome to access the api url, and it says certificate invalid. However i used qualsys labs ssl checker and it says all is fine, even reports that mobile browsers can access the url. I am out of ideas, any suggestions?
