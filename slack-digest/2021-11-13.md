__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hi folks, is there a way to toggle the `hardwareAccelerated` property during an app session i.e. after the app has launched? So for instance if the app is compiled with the value set to `"true"`, I would like to update that to `"false"` at various points during the app session, and return to `"true"` at other points. The closest thing I've found is the <https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#setLayoutDirection(int)|setLayerType> function for views, but the docs for <https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE|LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE> suggest that the behavior of this layer type is affected by whether hardware acceleration is disabled, so it seems that's not the right way to actually disable hardware acceleration itself.

> I interpret that LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE means hardware will be used when painting, assuming hardware is available enabled. If hardware is not enabled or is disabled (via OS settings perhaps) then `LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE` will behave exactly like `LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE`.
