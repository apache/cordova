> Hello! I need your help before I go nuts.
> I have quite severa problems.
> One is with gradle. When I do the cordova requirements, I get C:\pathto\Gradle\gradle-6.6.1\bin\gradle.BAT. So I guess my gradle version is 6.6.1.
> In my project structure, I get Android gradle plugin version 7.0.1 and gradle version 7.0.2
> And in my upgrade assistant on android studio, it goes down to 4.2.2 ... I don't get it. I have no idea how to solve this because right now, when I try to build, I have the "cannot find method compile()"  error. Of course I don't have compile anymore as it is implementation !
> 
> Second problem is that I have an error in my cordova.gradle file
> ```import io.github.g00fy2.versioncompare.Version```
> cannot resolve symbol 'io'. Which is a huge problem because now the versions in this file are not aknowledged and I can't build my app.
> 
> ```compileSdkVersion cordovaConfig.SDK_VERSION```
> this gets an error. to the system, cordovaConfig.SDK_VERSION just doesn't exist.
> You must think I am crazy, especially with the gradle mess, but I swear I don't know what happened xD

__@norman137__ says 
> A typical setup for Gradle is that you have system install (in your case, v 6.6.1) but that version isn't actually used for the overall build. A gradle project uses Gradle to download a specific version of Gradle to be used for that local project, this is called the gradle wrapper. So cordova will use gradle to install a local gradle wrapper at a specific version.

> This suggests that you have something else going on. The cordova config is provided by a JSON file which contains several variables, it should be generated by a defaults file, but manipulated based on preferences inside `config.xml`. At this point I'd probably suggest starting from scratch and work from there. Remove the platform via `cordova platform remove android`, and ensure that `platforms/android` doesn't actually exists. Then re-add it using `cordova platform add android@11` (11 is the latest version, but you could replace it with another version if you're aren't ready to use 11 yet)

> hello! thank your for your answer ðŸ™‚ .
> I agree with the compile element, I did change to implementation, but now, when I try to build, i have this error
> `Caused by: org.gradle.internal.metaobject.AbstractDynamicObject$CustomMessageMissingMethodException: Could not find method compile() for arguments [me.leolin:ShortcutBadger:1.1.22@aar] on object of type org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.dsl.dependencies.DefaultDependencyHandler.`
