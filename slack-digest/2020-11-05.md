__@ivan.harpley__ says 
> I was under the impression that doing `cordova platform add browser`, then `cordova prepare browser` followed by `cordova run browser` would result in `window.cordova` / `window.device` being available within the browser but it doesn't appear to be the case. Is there a way to Cordova available in the browser?

__@ivan.harpley__ says 
> Yes, but it doesn't fire. Even if I wait for the page to load an manually look for cordova / device in the console I can't find it... It's worth pointing out that this is for use in the Browser, rather than Electron (just in case I wasn't clear in my initial question)

__@norman137__ says 
> Native behaviour like that is often not modifiable by the browser. It might be possible through a plugin. The android webview class has many hook methods for things like that, but I don't know if that specifically is overridable.
> 
> Another potential solution that is pure JS is just to prevent the native behaviour (usually done by calling `event.preventDefault()`) and display your own popup menu instead.
