__@marek.kozela__ says 
> Hi everyone, in my project I am using cordova-plugin-save-image-gallery but it stopped working on Android devices. I also tried to replace it with cordova-plugin-save-image but still no success. Is there any solution for capturing an image and then save it to image gallery on Android? Thank you very much for your help ðŸ™‚

__@gh__ says 
> Anyone know about Code Signature versions? Building with the latest Cordova tooling, I get a Code Signature version of 20400, but <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/using_the_latest_code_signature_format|Apple's docs> say the latest version is 20500. Though that same document says 20400 and greater should be fine, I have a report of an ad-hoc build getting an error message when first started on an iOS 14.4 device.
