__@dpogue__ says 
> You can do MacStadium, MacInCloud, Mac on AWS EC2 for that sort of thing _but_ Apple's licensing terms mean that you have to pay for it a minimum of 24-hours at a time (so if you run a Mac EC2 instance for an hour to test something, you get billed for 24 hours. If you run it for 32 hours, you get billed for 32 hours)
