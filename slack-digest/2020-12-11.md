> We are developing the UWP application using the Cordova windows. The application connects with server to get the information. The application works perfectly if we connect the "external server host / Public host"
> Issue :
> If I have tried to connect the "Internal Server" using VPN in application, it does not connect. If run the Fiddler in back ground, it starts to connect the "Internal server" but, every time I could not ask customer to run the fiddler in background.
> Kindly Guide me. Do I need to any configuration inside the UWP application? Is this a default behavior of UWP application?
> If we add privateNetworkClientServer capability in Remote mode,App will fail in window store validation?

__@norman137__ says 
> Ideally it should be a single page app (aka SPA) -- if you use multiple pages you'll be "unloading" and reloading  you're environment and your app will very "websitey", instead of an actual app. Depending on how heavy your app is, it could be grounds for app store rejection.

> If you're building a very simple app, you'll be fine with multiple html pages.
