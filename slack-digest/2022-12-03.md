__@xinube__ says 
> After I bumped my project from cordova 9.x to 11 (and android 29 to 32) i have been dealing with unexpected CORS errors.
> The backend has allow origin set to * but it still persists.
> If I'm not mistaken, there was possibly a webview update somewhere in the past for cordova. Any chance this is related??
> Requests from webview are sent as <https://localhost|https://localhost>.. I wonder if I missed any config from older cordova migration

__@norman137__ says 
> Simply sending `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` isn't enough, there's a few more steps for proper CORS support on the backend
> 

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:22:24 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> For all the APIs, the backend should also respond to the `OPTIONS` method of the API and return the CORS headers in the response with no content body.

__@xinube__ says

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:23:03 GMT

__@norman137__ says

>     add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, OPTIONS, HEAD' always;

> Not sure what you mean by this. The CORS issues in the android webview would have started when schemes are used (Android calls it the `WebviewAssetLoader`). Using schemes solves some issues related to browser features that requires a secure context (e.g. it needs to be on a https protocol) but using that also enforces cors.

__@norman137__ says 
> Cordova implements the WebviewAssetLoader/scheme stuff in cordova-android 10.x

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:29:08 GMT

__@xinube__ says 
> As a first step I'm trying to figure out where is my mistake. Something missing in my cordova/ionic configs, API.
> After some head banging I wondered if it was in backend so I found an APK from when I hadn't bumped anything yet and installed. API endpoints worked. So I automatically guessed API misconfig out of the equation. Right?

__@xinube__ says 
> I did read something about webview 2.x to 3.x changing something about localhost:8080 to localhost but that shouldn't change much, especially because it is set to *

__@norman137__ says 
> no matter what your app's webview origin is, it's always going to be cross-origin to your server endpoint

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:32:53 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> In my experience to, using the `*` wildcard didn't always work, although my issues was with ios... not android

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:33:31 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> What I did instead is read the Request's `Origin` header and use that as the value for the Response's `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` value

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:33:53 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> which in nginx, is what `add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' $http_origin always;` line does, `$http_origin` is the variable for the request origin header

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:34:25 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Obivously I don't know your tech stack, but whatever what you use, should be able to translate it so it does the same thing.

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:35:16 GMT

__@xinube__ says 
> I didn't manually install any additional webview plugin.
> There's something I also always wondered. Even with * I always needed to manually change it to my local external ip if i wanted to run the app locally

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:36:17 GMT

__@xinube__ says 
> So instead of wildcard you dynamically read req on the fly and set it to allow

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:38:23 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Right

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:38:31 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:39:09 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> I'm not really confident that's your issue thogh, cause like I said I only ever experienced that on like... ios 10

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:39:29 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:40:44 GMT

__@xinube__ says 
> Yea, and with this I think I can safely discard new cordova/ionic migration configs (?) being the culprit
> 

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:43:57 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> if you are using the ionic webview, ionic has had the scheme stuff implemented for a long time now... , but idk if they used the same WebViewAssetLoader stuff behind the scenes. But if you are using the ionic webview, then I think it will override what Cordova does.

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:46:52 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> But as far as CORS goes... if you're returning the right `Access-Control` headers and responding to the `OPTIONS` request, then should be good...

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:46:56 GMT

__@xinube__ says 
> I do use ionic, if that automatically implies using their webview, then yes.
> So older webview implementations didn't enforce CORS? maybe it's something that was always there but the webview didn't care before
> 

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:48:33 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> I'm not 100% sure on this but I think the android system webview didn't enforce cors while on the `file:` protocol, but it does when using `WebViewAssetLoader` (which is what powers the https:// scheme for the app). But it could have also been simply a system webview update that made it started enforcing CORS, it's kinda hard to say tbh.

> There isn't any explicit documentation from Android about how CORS is handled.

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:51:00 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> There's also like 3 levels of security, 2 of which are browser features... some people get confused by them.
> 
> There's the CORS, CSP, and Cordova's allow list (formally called whitelist).

> So... I guess are you sure what you're seeing is a CORS issue?

__@xinube__ says 
> The project is from 2017 so a lot is possible hehe

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:52:04 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> CORS issues are usually identified by a lack of an error, perhaps simply stating a `Security Error.` with no other information, or sometimes you see preflight errors or it talks explicitly about `Access-Control` headers.
> 
> CSP errors will explicitly talk about `Content Security Policy`

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:54:48 GMT

__@xinube__ says 
> `Access to XMLHttpRequest at x from origin '<https://localhost|https://localhost>' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present in the requested resource`
> 

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:55:23 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> k, then yup... CORS ðŸ˜› but in that error it's stating that `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is missing
> 

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:55:31 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> So that sounds like a server misconfiguration
> 

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:57:24 GMT

__@xinube__ says 
> I don't have access to it, just to the source code, I can ask for a check, but the code for this header is present in the source code

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:57:35 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> `at x` is a remote server correct?

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:57:52 GMT

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:58:19 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Just wanted to make sure you're not XMLHttpRequesting `<http://localhost>` or something lol
> 

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:59:13 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> but yah that sounds like a server issue, that error is saying that the server didn't give a `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header so the browser blocked the request

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 17:00:03 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> If you hit the API manually via postman or something, you can inspect the response headers to confirm

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 17:00:36 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> If it is indeed missing, then that's definitely your issue.

__@xinube__ says

Fri, 02 Dec 2022 17:02:53 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> I'd try hitting both the `OPTIONS` version and the real endpoint and confirm that the headers are present in both http methods, and that they are the expected value.
