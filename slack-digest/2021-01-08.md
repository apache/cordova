__@pratiksha.bhavsar0895__ says 
> Heya Team , cordova app creates/updates platform/android and platform/ios after every build command. Is there any way to send value from cordova's www/html file to platform/android or platform/ios controllers ? i.e passing values from html to generated native code as we need to setup communication between cordova code &amp; platforms generated code. Please let me know if there is any solution as such. Thanks &amp; Kind Regards,Pratiksha. :)

__@norman137__ says 
> Sounds like you want to write a cordova plugin. You can't go directly from html to native, but there is a JS api that allows you to send serializable data (ie strings) to native. Of course, the JS can also read from the the DOM to pull that data from html.

__@ricardosohn__ says 
> Does anyone know what to do about the ITP issues on iOS 14?
> One screen of my app has an iframe inside a view, that loads content (with auth cookies).
> The content only loads if I set the '*NSCrossWebsiteTrackingUsageDescription'* and go to the settings and enabling '*Allow Cross-Website Tracking*'.
> I dont know the URLS in build time, since they are client-specific.
> Any ideas on how to handle this?

__@prasunjajodia__ says 
> Is there a known memory leak in `cordova-plugin-camera` for ios?
> The app crashes when opening the camera again after taking a lot of photos. But if it's working on a device with more RAM, it doesn't crash.
