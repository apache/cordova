__@aidanas__ says 
> Hi all! Just a quick question. With `cordova-plugin-file` you can get a `nativeUrl` and use it in html to render images (e.g. css background URL). But it seems to be non-reactive. Meaning, that if I update the contents of the file with another image it is not reflected on the UI unless logic to read the file is triggered again. I would understand this for dataUrl format where contents are returned as b46 string but this is just a normal URL, reading the file again returns the same nativeUrl since file name did not change.
