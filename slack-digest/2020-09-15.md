__@abul.asar22__ says 
> Hello Everyone, yesterday i was able to upgrade my cordova-ios to version 6.1.1 and other libaries as well. But on loading the app, all styling of the app is vanished. I can see following error.
> ```Cannot load stylesheet file:///private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/13F6252C-5D08-4B42-9E08-4DE75DB8C436/S.%20AppName.app/www/assets/vendor.css. Failed integrity metadata check. ```
> My intention to do upgrade was to remove `WebView` . Earlier I used other approach to remove WebView. I used `cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine` plugin to remove WebView but I got same error at that time as well.
> Can anyone guide to fix this error ?

__@norman137__ says 
> `cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine` is not compatible with `cordova-ios@6.x` . The plugin code was essentially moved into the `cordova-ios` (among with many enhancements). You don't need a wkwebview plugin when using `cordova-ios@6.x`

__@abul.asar22__ says 
> I got one answer on googling. The accepted answer is saying: `The problem appears to be with an cordova plugin: cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine.Removing the plugin does the trick. App loads normally after rebuilding.`  But is not going to work if we are upgrading ios.

__@norman137__ says 
> If you're using cordova-ios@6 then you don't need the `cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine` plugin.

Tue, 15 Sep 2020 04:45:04 GMT

__@abul.asar22__ says 
> yup.. i tried that earlier,  I am not using that now. As you said `cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine` is used internally with cordova-ios6 so may be that it is throwing this error.

__@erisu__ says 
> `cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine` , the plugin itself is not installed at all with Cordova iOS 6.x..
> 
> All of the plugin’s code was manually moved to the Cordova-iOS repo.
> 
> Since UIWebView was deprecated and no longer accepted by Apple, it was completely deleted from the Cordova-iOS repo. Because of that, we needed a webview enabled by default so that the app will still display. This is why WKWebView is integrated by default.

__@abul.asar22__ says 
> What is the reason for this error `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'window.plugins.actionsheet')` . I am getting one similar error related for `window.device.platform` but it seems because of `cordova-plugin-device` which is 1.1.1 version. I am upgrading it.
> But I am not sure about `window.plugins.actionsheet` .

Tue, 15 Sep 2020 07:49:37 GMT

__@erisu__ says 
> I dont know anything about the actionsheet plugin. You will need to contact the plugin developer for that one as Apache Cordova does not maintain that plugin.

__@lukas__ says 
> Hi everyone,
> we are using WK Webview and React and want to trigger another action when a user holds a button instead of pressing it.
> I try to listen for the events `touchstart` and `touchend` but they are only triggered after I release the button again. I want `touchstart` to immediatly fire when the button is being pressed. I also tried adding the CSS property `touch-action: manipulation` without success. Did someone of you implemented a long press on iOS?

__@pratiksha.bhavsar0895__ says 
> Hi team I am trying to incorporate markers on map on cordovaios6.1.1. As per documentation of a library have loaded its url with desired key,with div &amp; other initialization code . After the url is requested 3 more url (hidden) are called/hit i.e from within the library it is directly hit but the url scheme turns out to be <app://url1>, <app://url2> and <app://url3> due to which error appears with 404 status. While in android the same code works as expected with https:// as scheme. Is this because of wkwebkit implementation ? How will I changes scheme of url that are not accessible directly?

__@ucheozoemena__ says 
> Hi folks, I’m seeing a bug where images don’t have the correct orientation in a media picker plugin I’m using. Some are rotated 90 degrees and others are rotated 180, whereas some are upright. It _looks_ like only images taken by the camera are affected. I found this thread which looks like the same issue but I haven’t been able to make the code work for my plugin: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14066038/why-does-an-image-captured-using-camera-intent-gets-rotated-on-some-devices-on-a|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14066038/why-does-an-image-captured-using-camera-intent-gets-rotated-on-some-devices-on-a>. Has anyone encountered and solved something like this previously?
