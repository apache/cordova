__@iliasmerk__ says 
> Hello,Â 
> I updated the android version of an app that was 5.0.1 to android 9 with target sdk 28.
> The application didn't ask me for file storage permission and didn't start. My manifest has the _WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_
>  permission. Then I noticed that the file and media permission was declined. When I accept from android the permission the app started. How can I ask for the permission from the start of the app ?

> I'm having some problems with cordova-ios and ionic-v1 on the new macs...
> The CSS files wont load, and if I reload the page on the simulator it does show me the error "Did not parse stylesheet at '<ionic://localhost/css/app.css>' because non CSS MIME types are not allowed in strict mode.
> <ionic://localhost/lib/ionic-sdk/release/js/angular-sanitize.min.js.map>".
> Then I've checked in the network request, and it's coming as "application/octet-stream" instead of "text/css".
> Any ideas ?

__@norman137__ says 
> That's extra strange haha, I wouldn't expect there be a difference between intel-based macs and M1 macs here... I mean they both run a simulator, that means one of them is not "simulating" a device properly... I assume it works then when ran on a physical ios device?
