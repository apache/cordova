__@koshoni__ says 
> I successfully ran my first hello Cordova app and viewed it on an Android emulator. I'm now trying to clone an existing Cordova app from Github but I can't find any simple instructions on the exact sequence of steps to configure and run an existing project. I'm using Cordova CLI and will be debugging using VScode. Does anyone have some advice? ðŸ™‚

> Normal projects on github built on cordova would need:
> 1. Clone to local
> 2. `npm install`
> 3. `npm run build`  (varies from project to project.. special instructions, if any, should be provided in Readme.md)
> 4. `cordova platform add &lt;platform&gt;`
> 5. `cordova run &lt;platform&gt;`
