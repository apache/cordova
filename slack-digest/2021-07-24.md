> I want to get linebreak (\n) characters when I hit `Enter` in a contenteditable div. This is a fairly common question on stack overflow, and most of the solutions revolve around 2 ideas: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/19038104/7987987|using >`white-space: pre/pre-wrap`<https://stackoverflow.com/a/19038104/7987987| in CSS>, and <https://stackoverflow.com/a/20398548/7987987|overriding the >`keydown`<https://stackoverflow.com/a/20398548/7987987| event to insert the desired newline char instead of the >`&lt;div&gt;`. There are different implementations but the core ideas are roughly always those 2. My problem is that none of the variations I've found for these 2 ideas work in my app. The first idea just seems to not work, including when combined with `display: inline/inline-block` and no `display: flex` on the parent of the contenteditable div, as some answers suggest. The second idea suffers from an android limitation that `keydown`<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36753548/keycode-on-android-is-always-229| events do not report the key that has been pressed>, so it seems we're unable to confirm that the user pressed the Enter key _in the `keydown` event handler_ (not after the fact, but at the moment the key is pressed). So, what's a satisfactory way around this problem? I'd really appreciate any input, thanks in advance.
